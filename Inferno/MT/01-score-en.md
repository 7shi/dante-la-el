|    1 | 0.280 | 1234     | In the middle of the journey of our life          |
|    2 | 0.170 | 12678    | I found myself in a dark forest,                  |
|    3 | 0.208 | 3        | because the straight way was lost                 |
|    4 | 0.398 | 3        | Alas, how hard it is to say what it was like!     |
|    5 | 0.263 | 7        | This wild and rugged and strong forest            |
|    6 | 0.522 | 34       | that in the thought renews the fear!              |
|    7 | 0.333 | 8        | So bitter that little is more death;              |
|    8 | 0.191 | 257      | but to treat of the good that I found there,      |
|    9 | 0.275 | 4        | I will tell of the other things that I saw there. |
|   10 | 0.367 | 6        | I don't know how to explain how I entered it,     |
|   11 | 0.250 | 8        | So full of sleep at that point                    |
|   12 | 0.327 | 8        | that I abandoned the true way.                    |
|   13 | 0.303 | 6        | But then I reached the foot of a hill,            |
|   14 | 0.195 | 14678    | where that valley ended,                          |
|   15 | 0.520 | 12       | which had filled my heart with fear,              |
|   16 | 0.163 | 2348     | I looked up and saw his shoulders                 |
|   17 | 0.190 | 1        | already dressed with the rays of the planet       |
|   18 | 0.351 | 7        | Who leads others straight through every street.   |
|   19 | 0.241 | 367      | Then the fear was a little quiet,                 |
|   20 | 0.398 | 5        | Which in the lake of my heart had lasted          |
|   21 | 0.215 | 1        | the night that I spent with so much pity.         |
|   22 | 0.297 | 1        | And like those who with labored breath,           |
|   23 | 0.353 | 6        | came out of the ocean to the shore,               |
|   24 | 0.244 | 26       | turns to the perilous water and gazes,            |
|   25 | 0.225 | 6        | so my soul, which still fled,                     |
|   26 | 0.332 | 7        | He turned back to look at the pass                |
|   27 | 0.354 | 14       | that never left a living person.                  |
|   28 | 0.403 | 1        | Then after I had rested my weary body a little,   |
|   29 | 0.366 | 1        | I resumed my way along the deserted shore,        |
|   30 | 0.192 | 67       | so that the firm foot was always the lowest.      |
|   31 | 0.139 | 124      | And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope, |
|   32 | 0.518 | 2        | a light and very swift she-wolf,                  |
|   33 | 0.310 | 8        | which was covered with spotted hair;              |
|   34 | 0.364 | 245      | and it did not depart from before my face,        |
|   35 | 0.431 | 4        | Instead it hindered my way so much,               |
|   36 | 0.470 | 5        | That I was to return several times turned.        |
|   37 | 0.196 | 1578     | Time was from the beginning of the morning,       |
|   38 | 0.188 | 1        | and the sun was rising up with those stars        |
|   39 | 0.144 | 4        | Who were with him when the divine love            |
|   40 | 0.356 | 1        | moved those beautiful things at first;            |
|   41 | 0.533 | 5        | So that to good hope was the cause for me         |
|   42 | 0.505 | 5        | Of that fair to the fair skin                     |
|   43 | 0.270 | 1356     | the hour of time and the sweet season;            |
|   44 | 0.469 | 35       | but not so that fear did not give me              |
|   45 | 0.370 | 135678   | the sight that appeared to me of a lion.          |
|   46 | 0.256 | 23       | He seemed to come against me,                     |
|   47 | 0.250 | 4        | With the head high and with furious hunger,       |
|   48 | 0.311 | 4        | So that it seemed that the air trembled.          |
|   49 | 0.427 | 5        | And a she-wolf, who of all lusts                  |
|   50 | 0.354 | 3        | seemed laden not in her thinness,                 |
|   51 | 0.512 | 2        | and had already made many people live in misery,  |
|   52 | 0.378 | 38       | this gave me so much heaviness                    |
|   53 | 0.205 | 3        | with the fear that came out of her sight          |
|   54 | 0.234 | 13       | that I lost the hope of the height.               |
|   55 | 0.255 | 5        | And what is he who willingly acquires,            |
|   56 | 0.418 | 23       | and reaches the time that makes him lose,         |
|   57 | 0.473 | 1        | who in all his thoughts cries and becomes sad;    |
|   58 | 0.353 | 1        | such the beast without peace made me,             |
|   59 | 0.170 | 56       | Who, coming towards me, little by little          |
|   60 | 0.243 | 24       | pushed me back to where the sun is silent.        |
|   61 | 0.174 | 57       | While I was ruining in a low place,               |
|   62 | 0.503 | 7        | before my eyes was offered                        |
|   63 | 0.245 | 5        | Who for long silence seemed dim.                  |
|   64 | 0.097 | 12345678 | When I saw this man in the great desert,          |
|   65 | 0.212 | 7        | "Mercy on me," I cried to him,                    |
|   66 | 0.298 | 8        | "whatever you are, or shadow or certain man!"     |
|   67 | 0.363 | 4        | He answered me: "Not man, I was already a man,    |
|   68 | 0.161 | 1278     | and my relatives were Lombards,                   |
|   69 | 0.407 | 34       | mantuans by homeland both."                       |
|   70 | 0.281 | 7        | I was born sub Iulio, even though it was late,    |
|   71 | 0.047 | 2367     | and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus       |
|   72 | 0.131 | 3457     | in the time of the false and lying gods.          |
|   73 | 0.235 | 28       | I was a poet, and I sang of that righteous        |
|   74 | 0.129 | 123467   | son of Anchises who came from Troy,               |
|   75 | 0.177 | 147      | after the proud Ilion was burned.                 |
|   76 | 0.246 | 6        | But why do you return to such boredom?            |
|   77 | 0.248 | 2        | Why do you not climb the delightful mountain      |
|   78 | 0.056 | 14578    | which is the beginning and cause of all joy?"     |
|   79 | 0.143 | 134      | "Now are you that Virgil and that fountain        |
|   80 | 0.560 | 7        | What do you spread to speak so wide a river?"     |
|   81 | 0.212 | 7        | I answered him with a shameful brow.              |
|   82 | 0.530 | 1236     | "O honor and light of the other poets,            |
|   83 | 0.257 | 2        | let the long study and the great love             |
|   84 | 0.270 | 7        | That made me seek your volume.                    |
|   85 | 0.115 | 134      | You are my master and my author,                  |
|   86 | 0.189 | 6        | you are only the one from whom I took             |
|   87 | 0.220 | 7        | the beautiful style that has done me honor.       |
|   88 | 0.178 | 6        | See the beast for which I turned;                 |
|   89 | 0.067 | 234567   | help me from her, famous sage,                    |
|   90 | 0.153 | 5        | For she makes my veins and wrists tremble."       |
|   91 | 0.499 | 3        | You must take another journey                     |
|   92 | 0.280 | 346      | he replied, when he saw me weeping,               |
|   93 | 0.321 | 146      | "if you want to escape from this wild place;"     |
|   94 | 0.199 | 34       | for this beast, for which you cry,                |
|   95 | 0.219 | 358      | does not let others pass by his way,              |
|   96 | 0.356 | 8        | but so much so that it kills him;                 |
|   97 | 0.461 | 1        | and has a nature so wicked and vile,              |
|   98 | 0.291 | 4        | That it never fills the greedy desire,            |
|   99 | 0.149 | 1        | and after the meal has more hunger than before.   |
|  100 | 0.295 | 78       | Many are the animals to which he marries,         |
|  101 | 0.322 | 8        | and more will be, until the veltro                |
|  102 | 0.248 | 6        | will come, which will make her die in pain.       |
|  103 | 0.268 | 8        | He will not eat earth or pewter,                  |
|  104 | 0.057 | 34578    | but wisdom, love, and virtue,                     |
|  105 | 0.036 | 123467   | and his nation will be between felt and felt.     |
|  106 | 0.426 | 7        | Of that humble Italy will be health               |
|  107 | 0.121 | 123      | for which the virgin Camilla died,                |
|  108 | 0.153 | 36       | Euryalus and Turnus and Nisus of wounds.          |
|  109 | 0.363 | 7        | He will hunt her through every villa,             |
|  110 | 0.250 | 36       | until he has put her back in hell,                |
|  111 | 0.395 | 6        | there where envy first departs.                   |
|  112 | 0.442 | 3        | Therefore, I think and discern through your face  |
|  113 | 0.053 | 1234678  | that you follow me, and I will be your guide,     |
|  114 | 0.273 | 1        | and lead you from here to eternal place;          |
|  115 | 0.103 | 126      | where you will hear the desperate cries,          |
|  116 | 0.179 | 68       | you will see the ancient sorrowful spirits,       |
|  117 | 0.460 | 8        | that at the second death each cries;              |
|  118 | 0.204 | 124      | and you will see those who are content            |
|  119 | 0.000 | 12345678 | in the fire, because they hope to come            |
|  120 | 0.206 | 12       | whenever it may be to the blessed people.         |
|  121 | 0.410 | 4        | To which then if you will want to ascend,         |
|  122 | 0.372 | 3        | the soul will be to that more worthy than me      |
|  123 | 0.247 | 1478     | with her I will leave you in my departure;        |
|  124 | 0.315 | 4        | For that emperor who reigns up there,             |
|  125 | 0.222 | 6        | because I was rebellious against his law,         |
|  126 | 0.435 | 7        | He does not want me to come to his city.          |
|  127 | 0.391 | 6        | In all parts he reigns and reigns there;          |
|  128 | 0.178 | 56       | There is his city and his high seat:              |
|  129 | 0.342 | 3        | oh, happy is he whom he elects here!              |
|  130 | 0.253 | 4        | And I to him: "Poet, I beg you                    |
|  131 | 0.138 | 1347     | for that God whom you did not know,               |
|  132 | 0.149 | 3        | so that I may flee this evil and worse            |
|  133 | 0.277 | 3        | that you lead me there where you said             |
|  134 | 0.138 | 8        | so that I may see the door of Saint Peter         |
|  135 | 0.260 | 14       | and those whom you make so sad.                   |
|  136 | 0.226 | 136      | Then he moved, and I followed him.                |
