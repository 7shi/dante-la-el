|    1 | 0.280 | 1234     | In the middle of the journey of our life                |
|    2 | 0.159 | 123678   | I found myself in a dark forest,                        |
|    3 | 0.301 | 14       | because the straight way was lost.                      |
|    4 | 0.494 | 1        | Alas, how hard it is to tell what that forest was       |
|    5 | 0.256 | 7        | This wild and rugged and strong forest                  |
|    6 | 0.432 | 2        | that renews the fear in the thought!                    |
|    7 | 0.358 | 18       | So bitter that little is more death;                    |
|    8 | 0.147 | 2357     | but to treat of the good that I found there,            |
|    9 | 0.269 | 34       | I will tell of the other things that I saw there.       |
|   10 | 0.386 | 24       | I do not know well how I entered there,                 |
|   11 | 0.184 | 18       | so full of sleep at that point                          |
|   12 | 0.322 | 148      | that I abandoned the true way.                          |
|   13 | 0.296 | 6        | But then I reached the foot of a hill,                  |
|   14 | 0.181 | 345      | there where that valley ended                           |
|   15 | 0.486 | 4        | that had filled my heart with fear,                     |
|   16 | 0.161 | 128      | I looked up and saw his shoulders                       |
|   17 | 0.152 | 23467    | already clothed with the rays of the planet             |
|   18 | 0.301 | 7        | Who leads others straight through every street.         |
|   19 | 0.227 | 2        | Then the fear was a little quieted,                     |
|   20 | 0.408 | 236      | which had lasted in the lake of my heart                |
|   21 | 0.239 | 267      | the night I spent with so much pity.                    |
|   22 | 0.309 | 1        | And like those who, with exhausted breath,              |
|   23 | 0.310 | 6        | came out of the ocean to the shore,                     |
|   24 | 0.255 | 246      | turns to the perilous water and gazes,                  |
|   25 | 0.251 | 2        | so my soul, which still was fleeing,                    |
|   26 | 0.364 | 4        | turned back to look at the path                         |
|   27 | 0.376 | 678      | which never left a person alive.                        |
|   28 | 0.314 | 3        | Then, when I had rested my weary body a little,         |
|   29 | 0.361 | 34       | I resumed my way along the deserted shore,              |
|   30 | 0.229 | 67       | so that the firm foot was always the lowest.            |
|   31 | 0.134 | 1234     | And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,       |
|   32 | 0.534 | 1        | a light and very swift lynx,                            |
|   33 | 0.317 | 8        | which was covered with spotted hair;                    |
|   34 | 0.384 | 25       | and it did not depart from before my face,              |
|   35 | 0.429 | 2        | indeed, it hindered so much my path,                    |
|   36 | 0.453 | 3        | that I was about to turn back many times.               |
|   37 | 0.200 | 78       | It was from the beginning of the morning,               |
|   38 | 0.171 | 345      | and the sun was rising with those stars                 |
|   39 | 0.148 | 678      | who were with him when divine love                      |
|   40 | 0.340 | 8        | moved those beautiful things before;                    |
|   41 | 0.532 | 4        | so that it was a cause for me to hope well              |
|   42 | 0.537 | 5        | Of that fair to the fair skin                           |
|   43 | 0.282 | 56       | The hour of time and the sweet season;                  |
|   44 | 0.445 | 3        | but not so much that fear did not give me               |
|   45 | 0.333 | 345678   | the sight that appeared to me of a lion.                |
|   46 | 0.287 | 2        | He seemed to come against me,                           |
|   47 | 0.287 | 4        | with its head high and with angry hunger,               |
|   48 | 0.286 | 3        | so that it seemed that the air trembled.                |
|   49 | 0.300 | 4        | And a she-wolf, who of all desires                      |
|   50 | 0.319 | 1        | seemed loaded in her thinness,                          |
|   51 | 0.400 | 3        | and many people made already live miserable,            |
|   52 | 0.341 | 7        | This one gave me so much gravity                        |
|   53 | 0.191 | 34       | with the fear that came out of her sight,               |
|   54 | 0.220 | 134      | that I lost the hope of the height.                     |
|   55 | 0.330 | 5        | And what is he who willingly acquires,                  |
|   56 | 0.385 | 3        | and the time comes that makes him lose it,              |
|   57 | 0.442 | 4        | who in all his thoughts weeps and is sad;               |
|   58 | 0.387 | 14       | such did the beast without peace make me,               |
|   59 | 0.155 | 13       | that, coming towards me, little by little               |
|   60 | 0.220 | 12       | pushed me back to where the sun is silent.              |
|   61 | 0.176 | 57       | While I was ruining in a low place,                     |
|   62 | 0.407 | 3        | before my eyes was offered to me                        |
|   63 | 0.360 | 5        | Who for long silence seemed dim.                        |
|   64 | 0.093 | 467      | When I saw this man in the great desert,                |
|   65 | 0.198 | 7        | "Mercy on me," I cried to him,                          |
|   66 | 0.245 | 8        | "whatever you are, or shadow or certain man!"           |
|   67 | 0.413 | 1        | He answered me: "I am not a man; I was once a man,      |
|   68 | 0.161 | 1278     | and my relatives were Lombards,                         |

|   71 | 0.025 | 123467   | and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus             |
|   72 | 0.131 | 3457     | in the time of the false and lying gods.                |
|   73 | 0.232 | 28       | I was a poet, and I sang of that righteous              |

|   75 | 0.226 | 7        | after the proud Ili√≥n was burned.                       |
|   76 | 0.269 | 6        | But why do you return to such boredom?                  |

|   80 | 0.514 | 6        | what do you say about speaking so wide a river?",       |
|   81 | 0.293 | 7        | I answered him with a shameful brow.                    |

|   92 | 0.266 | 36       | he replied, when he saw me weeping,                     |
