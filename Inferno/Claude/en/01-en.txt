In the middle of the path of our life
I found myself in a dark wood,
for the right way was lost.
Alas, how hard it is to tell what it was
this wild, harsh and stubborn forest
which renews the fear in my mind!
So much is it bitter that death is little more;
but in order to discuss the good that I found there,
I will tell you of the other things that I perceived there.
I do not know well how to tell again how I entered there,
I was so full of sleep at that point
that I abandoned the true way.
But then, when I was at the foot of a hill arrived,
there, where that valley ended
which had touched my heart with fear,
I looked on high and saw its shoulders
already clothed with the rays of the planet
which rightly leads others on every path.
Then the fear was a little quiet,
which had lasted in the lake of my heart
the night that I passed with so much pity.
And as he who with labored breath,
having exited from the sea to the shore,
turns to the dangerous water and looks,
thus my soul, which still was fleeing,
turned itself to gaze back at the step
which no living person ever left.
Then, when I had rested my weary body a little,
I took my way again along the deserted slope,
so that the firm foot was always the lower one.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a very light and nimble lynx,
which was covered with a mottled fur;
and did not remove itself from before my face,
but impeded my way so much,
that many times I turned about to go back.
It was the time from the beginning of morning,
and the sun was rising up with those stars
that were with it when divine love
first moved those beautiful things;
so that to have good hope was reason for me
because of that beast with the light colored skin
the hour of the time and the sweet season;
but not so much that fear did not give me
the sight which appeared to me of a lion.
This one seemed to come against me
with his head held high and with rabid hunger,
so that it seemed that the air around him trembled.
And a she-wolf, which with all cravings
seemed laden in her own leanness,
and had already made many people live sadly,
this me set so much of heaviness
with the fear that issued from her appearance,
that I lost the hope of the height.
And what is he who willingly acquires,
and arrives the time that lose it makes,
that in all his thoughts cries and himself saddens;
such made me the beast without peace,
that, coming towards me, little by little
drove back me there where the sun is silent.
While that I was falling into low place,
in front of the eyes me itself was offered
he who because of long silence seemed faint.
When I saw this man in the great wasteland,
"Have mercy on me", I cried to him,
"whoever you may be, either shade or man indeed!"
He answered me: "Not man, man once I was,
and the relatives my were Lombards,
from Mantua by homeland both.
I was born under Julius, although it was late,
and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus
in the time of the false and lying gods.
Poet I was, and I sang of that just
son of Anchises which came from Troy,
after the proud Ilium was burned.
But you why do you return to such annoyance?
why do you not climb the delightful mount
which is principle and cause of all joy?"
"Now are you that Virgil and that fountain
who pours with speech so ample river?"
I answered him with shameful brow.
"O of the other poets honor and light,
may avails me the long study and the great love
that me has made look for the your volume.
You are the my master and the my author,
you are only he by whom I took
the beautiful style that me has made honor.
See the beast for which I myself turned;
help me from her, famous sage,
which she me makes tremble the veins and the wrists."
"To you is fitting to take another journey",
he answered, then when crying me (he) saw,
"if you want to escape from this savage place;
for this beast, for which you cry out,
does not leave another to pass through its way,
but so much it impedes that kills it;
and has nature so evil and cruel,
that never not fills the greedy desire,
and after the meal has more hunger than before.
Many are the animals to which it joins,
and more will be still, until the greyhound
will come, that it will make die with pain.
This one will not feed on earth nor pewter,
but wisdom, love and virtue,
and its nation will be between felt and felt.
From that humble Italy will be salvation
for which died the maiden Camilla,
Euryalus and Turnus and Nisus of wounds.
This one will hunt it through every town,
until it will have put again in hell,
there from where envy first drew it away.
Whence I for your better (judgment) think and discern
that you me should follow, and I will be your guide,
and will draw you away from here through place eternal;
where you will hear the desperate cries,
you will see the ancient sorrowful spirits,
that to the second death each cries;
and you will see those who are content
in the fire, because they hope to come
when it may be to the blessed people.
To the which then if you will want to ascend,
soul will be to this more than me worthy:
with it I will leave you in my departing;
for that emperor that there up reigns he,
because I was rebellious to his law,
he not wants that in his city through me may come.
In all parts he rules and there rules;
there is his city and the high seat:
oh happy him who there elects!"
And I to him "you ask
by that God that you not knew,
so that I may flee this evil and worse,
that you me may lead there where now said,
yes that I may see the gate of saint Peter
and those whom you make so much sad."
Then himself moved and I him kept behind.
