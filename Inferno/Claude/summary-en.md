# Inferno

## Canto I

The narrator finds himself lost in a dark forest and encounters a leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf that impede his progress. He then meets the spirit of the Roman poet Virgil, who says he has been sent to guide the narrator on a journey through the afterlife. Virgil explains that the she-wolf represents greed and avarice, and that someday a prophesied hero will come who will defeat the she-wolf. Virgil agrees to guide the narrator through Hell and Purgatory, but says he cannot enter Heaven because he was a pagan. The narrator begs Virgil to lead him on this journey so he can see Hell and Purgatory and hopefully make his way to Heaven. Virgil agrees and they set off together.

## Canto II

The narrator is hesitant about embarking on the journey through the afterlife, feeling unworthy compared to legendary heroes like Aeneas and St. Paul who undertook similar journeys. Virgil assures him that he was sent by Beatrice, a woman the narrator loved in life, who is now in Heaven and wants Virgil to guide him on this journey. Virgil says Beatrice sent him because she is concerned about the narrator being lost and frightened. 

Virgil explains that Beatrice spoke to the saint Lucia about helping the narrator, who then told Rachel, and the three of them petitioned God to allow Virgil to come to the narrator's aid. Virgil says he is not afraid to go through Hell because he is a spirit and cannot be harmed by the flames. With this encouragement, the narrator agrees to continue, feeling renewed commitment and courage to undertake the journey through the Inferno with Virgil as his guide.
