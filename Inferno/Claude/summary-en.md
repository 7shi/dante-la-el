# Inferno

## Canto 1

The narrator finds himself lost in a dark forest and encounters a leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf that impede his progress. He then meets the spirit of the Roman poet Virgil, who says he has been sent to guide the narrator on a journey through the afterlife. Virgil explains that the she-wolf represents greed and avarice, and that someday a prophesied hero will come who will defeat the she-wolf. Virgil agrees to guide the narrator through Hell and Purgatory, but says he cannot enter Heaven because he was a pagan. The narrator begs Virgil to lead him on this journey so he can see Hell and Purgatory and hopefully make his way to Heaven. Virgil agrees and they set off together.

## Canto 2

The narrator is hesitant about embarking on the journey through the afterlife, feeling unworthy compared to legendary heroes like Aeneas and St. Paul who undertook similar journeys. Virgil assures him that he was sent by Beatrice, a woman the narrator loved in life, who is now in Heaven and wants Virgil to guide him on this journey. Virgil says Beatrice sent him because she is concerned about the narrator being lost and frightened. 

Virgil explains that Beatrice spoke to the saint Lucia about helping the narrator, who then told Rachel, and the three of them petitioned God to allow Virgil to come to the narrator's aid. Virgil says he is not afraid to go through Hell because he is a spirit and cannot be harmed by the flames. With this encouragement, the narrator agrees to continue, feeling renewed commitment and courage to undertake the journey through the Inferno with Virgil as his guide.

## Canto 3

- Dante and Virgil arrive at the gates of Hell, which bear an inscription warning that all hope must be abandoned here. Dante is hesitant but Virgil urges him to have courage.

- They enter the first circle of Hell, called Limbo, where pagans and virtuous non-Christians dwell. There is no physical torment here, only sadness at their separation from God. 

- Dante sees a crowd of solemn spirits, including philosophers and poets. Virgil explains this is the home of those who led honorable lives but were born before Christ so they could not enter Heaven.

- Moving further into Hell, Dante hears terrible cries of lamentation. Virgil says this is the second circle, for the lustful, who are condemned to be constantly buffeted by fierce winds. 

- Dante recognizes some sinners here, including Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Achilles, Paris and Tristan.

- At the banks of the river Acheron, Dante sees a boat ferrying souls to the underworld. The ferryman Charon initially refuses Dante entry since he is still living, but Virgil persuades him to let them continue.

## Canto 4

- Dante awakens to find himself at the edge of Hell. Virgil urges him to descend into the first circle, Limbo.

- In Limbo there is no physical torment, only sadness. Here dwell virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants who did not sin but cannot enter Heaven. 

- Virgil explains he too resides in Limbo, since he lived before Christianity. Other worthy souls are there, but none by their own merit - only Christ once descended to Limbo to rescue some.

- Dante sees a radiant light in the distance, and honorable souls residing there. Virgil identifies them as philosophers, poets, heroes and scholars, including Homer, Ovid, Horace and others. 

- They welcome Dante as one of their own. Continuing on, they come to a beautiful castle with meadows and yet more illustrious souls, including mythological and historical figures.

- In a separate area Dante sees philosophers and thinkers, including Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Seneca and others.

- Virgil then leads Dante away, toward a place where no light shines.

## Canto 5

- Dante and Virgil descend to the second circle of Hell, where the lustful are punished. 

- The judge Minos sentences each soul to their punishment. He indicates to Dante the circle is for those who let their appetites rule their reason.

- In this circle, the souls are buffeted about violently by a fierce storm without rest, symbolic of how they were helpless before their passions in life.

- Virgil names some of the suffering souls - Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Achilles, Paris, Tristan. 

- Dante speaks with two souls, Francesca and her lover Paolo, who recount their story - while reading the legend of Lancelot they were overcome and fell in love, but were murdered by Francesca's husband when he discovered their affair. 

- Dante faints from pity when he hears how Francesca still longs for Paolo even amidst their torment.
