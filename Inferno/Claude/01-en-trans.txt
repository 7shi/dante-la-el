In the middle of the journey of our life
I found myself in a dark forest,
because the right way was lost.
Ah, how hard it is to tell what it was like,
this wild, rough and difficult forest,
which in memory renews my fear!
It is so bitter that death is hardly more so;
but to treat of the good that I found therein
I will tell of the other things I saw there.
I do not know well how I entered it,
I was so full of sleep at that point
that I abandoned the true way.
But when I had reached the foot of a hill,
there where that valley ended,
which had pierced my heart with fear,
I looked up on high and saw its shoulders
already clothed with the rays of the planet
that leads others straight on every path.
Then my fear was quieted a little,
that had lasted in the lake of my heart
the night that I passed with so much pity.
And as one who with panting breath,
having issued from the deep onto the shore
turns back to gaze at the perilous water,
so my soul, that still was fleeing,
turned back to look again at the pass
that no one has ever left alive.
After I had rested my weary body a little,
I resumed my way over the lonely slope,
so that my steady foot was always lowest.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a swift and nimble leopard,
which was covered with spotted fur;
and it did not leave my sight,
rather it impeded my path so much
that I was turned back many times.
It was the early morning,
and the sun was rising up with those stars
that were with him when Divine Love
first set those beautiful things in motion;
so that the hour of the time and the sweet season
gave me good cause to hope
regarding that beast with the gay skin;
but not so much that the sight
of a lion did not give me fear.
This one seemed to come against me
with his head held high and with rabid hunger,
so that it seemed the air trembled with fear.
And a she-wolf, that seemed burdened
with all desires in her leanness,
and has already made many people live wretched,
this one brought me so much heaviness
with the fear that poured from her sight,
that I lost hope of the heights.
And as one who willingly acquires
and comes to the time that makes him lose,
so that in all his thoughts he weeps and is saddened;
such did the restless beast make me,
that, coming against me, little by little,
drove me back there where the sun is silent.
While I was falling into the low place,
before my eyes one had offered himself
who by his long silence seemed faint.
When I saw him in the great desert,
"Have mercy on me," I cried to him,
"whatever you may be, whether shade or living man!"
He answered me: "Not a living man, though once I was,
and my parents were Lombards,
Mantuans by country, both of them.
I was born sub Julio, though late,
and I lived in Rome under good Augustus,
in the time of the false and lying gods.
A poet was I, and I sang of that just
son of Anchises who came from Troy
after proud Ilion was burned.
But why do you return to so much woe?
Why do you not climb the delightful mount
which is the source and cause of all joy?".
"Now are you that Virgil, and that fountain,
that spreads forth so wide a river of speech?",
I replied to him with shamefaced brow.
"O honor and light of all other poets,
may my long study and great love avail me,
that has made me search through your volume.
You are my master and my author,
you alone are he from whom I took
the beautiful style that has brought me honor.
See the beast because of whom I turned back;
help me against her, famous sage,
for she makes my veins and pulses tremble."
“It behooves you to hold another course,”
he replied, once he saw me weep,
“if you wish to escape from this savage place:
for this beast, because of whom you cry out,
allows no one to pass along her path,
but hinders him so that she kills him;
and her nature is so malign and evil
that she never fills her greedy will,
and after eating she is hungrier than before.
Many are the animals to which she mates,
and more there will be still, until the greyhound
comes that will make her die in pain.
This one will not feed on land or money,
but on wisdom, love and virtue,
and his nation will be between Feltro and Feltro.
From that humble Italy shall come salvation,
for which the virgin Camilla died of wounds,
as Euryalus, Turnus and Nisus.
This one shall hunt her down through every city,
until he has put her back into hell,
whence envy first set her loose.
So I think and judge for your best interest
that you follow me as I will be your guide,
and lead you from here through an eternal place;
where you will hear hopeless shrieks,
will see ancient suffering spirits,
as each cries out for the second death;
and you will see those who are content
in fire, because they hope to come,
when it may be, to join the blessed people.
To which, if you then wish to ascend,
a soul shall be worthier than I:
with her I will leave you at my departure;
for that emperor who reigns above,
because I was rebellious against His law,
does not wish that through me one comes into His city.
In all places He governs and there He rules;
there is His city and exalted throne:
oh happy he whom He chooses there!".
And I to him: "Poet, I beseech you,
by that God whom you did not know,
so that I may flee this evil and worse,
that you lead me there where you just said,
so that I may see the Gate of St. Peter,
and those people whom you make so sorrowful."
Then he moved on, and I kept to his heels.
