In the middle of the journey of our life
I found myself in a dark forest,
because the straight way was lost.
Alas, how hard it is to say what it was
this wild and rough and strong forest
that renews the fear in thought!
So bitter that little is more than death;
but to speak of the good that I found there,
I will tell of the other things that I saw there.
I cannot well say how I entered there,
so full of sleep at that point
that I abandoned the true way.
But then, when I was at the foot of a hill,
where that valley ended,
which had pierced my heart with fear,
I looked up and saw his/her/its shoulders
already dressed in the rays of the planet
that leads straight to others through every path.
Then the fear was a little calm,
that in the lake of my heart had lasted
the night that I passed with so much pity.
And like those who, with panting breath,
having come out of the sea to the shore,
turns towards the dangerous water and looks,
so my soul, which still fled,
turned back to look at the step
that had never left anyone alive.
Then, having rested my weary body a little,
I resumed my way along the deserted shore,
so that the stationary foot was always the lowest.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a light and very fast lynx,
that was covered with spotted fur;
and did not depart from in front of my face,
rather, it hindered my path so much,
that I was turned back several times.
The time was from the beginning of the morning,
and the sun was rising up with those stars
that were with him when divine love
moved those beautiful things first;
so that I had good reason to hope
for that beast with the joyful skin.
the hour of the time and the sweet season;
but not so that fear did not give me
the sight that appeared to me of a lion.
This one seemed to be coming against me
with a high head and with furious hunger,
so that it seemed that the air was trembling.
And a she-wolf, who in all desires
seemed laden in her thinness,
and made many people already live harsh lives,
this gave me so much heaviness
with the fear that came out of her sight,
that I lost the hope of the height.
And he who willingly acquires,
and reaches the time that makes him lose it,
who in all his thoughts cries and becomes sad;
such did the beast make me without peace,
that, coming towards me, little by little
it pushed me back to where the sun is silent.
While I was falling to a low place,
before my eyes, it was offered to me
one who, through a long silence, seemed faint.
When I saw this one in the great desert,
"Have mercy on me," I cried to him,
"whoever you may be, whether shadow or certain man!"
He answered me: "Not a man, I was once a man,
and my relatives were Lombards,
mantuans by homeland, both of us.
I was born under Julius, though it was late,
and I lived in Rome under good Augustus,
in the time of false and deceitful gods.
I was a poet, and I sang of that just one
son of Anchises who came from Troy,
after proud Ilium was burned.
But why do you return to so much trouble?
why don't you climb the delightful mountain
which is the beginning and cause of all joy?
"Now, are you that Virgil and that source
who pours forth such a wide river of speech?"
I answered him with a shameful face.
"Oh honor and light of the other poets,
may the long study and great love
that has made me seek your volume.
You are my master and my author,
you alone are the one from whom I took
the beautiful style that has honored me.
See the beast for whom I turned;
help me from it, famous sage,
because it makes my veins and wrists tremble."
"You must undertake another journey,"
he replied, after he saw me weeping,
"if you want to escape from this wild place;
because this beast, for which you cry,
does not allow others to pass through its way,
but it hinders him so much that it kills him;
and it has such wicked and cruel nature,
that it never fills the greedy desire,
and after the meal, it has more hunger than before.
Many are the animals to which it mates,
and there will be more until the greyhound
comes, which will make her die with pain.
This one will feed neither on earth nor pewter,
but on wisdom, love, and virtue,
and his nation will be between felt and felt.
From that humble Italy will come salvation,
for whom the virgin Camilla died,
Eurialo, Turnus, and Nisus from wounds.
This one will chase her through every town,
until he has put her back in hell,
there where envy first departs.
Therefore, I think more for your sake and discern,
that you follow me, and I will be your guide,
and I will lead you from here through eternal places;
where you will hear the desperate cries,
you will see the ancient suffering spirits,
who cry out for the second death;
and you will see those who are content,
in the fire, because they hope to come
when it is time for the blessed people.
To which, then, if you will want to climb,
a soul will be more worthy of this than me:
with her, I will leave you in my departure;
because that emperor who reigns above there,
because I was rebellious to his law,
he does not want that one may come to his city for me.
He rules in all parts, and governs there;
there is his city and the high seat:
oh, happy is the one who chooses to be there!".
And I said to him: "Poet, I ask you
by that God whom you did not know,
so that I may flee this evil and worse,
so that you may lead me to where you said,
so that I may see the gate of Saint Peter
and those whom you make so sad.".
Then he moved, and I kept behind him.
