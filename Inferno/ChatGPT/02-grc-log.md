Here is the word-by-word table for the provided text in the source language (which appears to be Ancient Greek), along with the English translation:

| ἐγὼ            | ἐγώ             | I                         |
| δὲ             | δέ              | but                       |
| μόνος           | μόνος            | alone                     |

Please note that this table represents a word-by-word translation and may not necessarily capture the complete meaning of the original text, as Ancient Greek often relies on inflections and context for full comprehension.

    For each line of the original text, connect the words from the immediately preceding table to form an English sentence.

Certainly, here are the English sentences formed by connecting the words from the original text using the word-by-word table:

1. The day was passing, and all...
2. The dark air upon the earth, living...
3. Of those labors drove away. I alone...

Again, please keep in mind that this word-by-word translation may not capture the full nuance or structure of the original text, as Ancient Greek has its own syntax and inflections that affect the meaning and flow of the sentences.

| περιγράψει      | περιγράφω        | will describe          |

Now, let's connect the words to form English sentences based on the original text:

1. I was preparing to bear the weight...
2. Of the journey and the psychological passion,
3. Who now, my faithful memory will describe.

Please note that Ancient Greek syntax and word order differ from English, so the sentences may not follow the same structure, but this word-by-word translation conveys the meaning of the original text.

Now, let's connect the words to form English sentences based on the original text:

1. O Muses, divine spirit, now help;
2. O memory, in which all that I saw is written,
3. Now your solemn oratory will appear.

Now, let's connect the words to form English sentences based on the original text:

1. "Just as if someone who no longer wants what he wished,
2. and changing his mind through new aims,
