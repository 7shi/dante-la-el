The day passed away, and all
The dark air the living on the earth
Drove away of the labors; but I alone
I was preparing to bear the burden
Of the journey and the psychological passion,
Who now, my faithful memory will describe.
O Muses, divine spirit, now help;
O memory, in which all that I saw is written,
Now your solemn oratory will appear.
"Guide my poet," I began to say,
"Look at my worthy tell at once,
Before I advance into the terrible journey.
You say to come the grandfather of Silvius,
Still being mortal, into the land of the immortals,
Having the perceptions of a living man.
But if indeed the enemy of all evil
was to him goodwill, thinking noble and great,
departing from him, what kind and what kind
It does not seem unbecoming to a wise man this,
For he himself father of revered Rome and Power
was chosen in heavens' sky.
Rome and Power, so that I may say rightly,
were ordained as a certain sacred place,
where the successor of Peter resides.
From the journey, which you praised, this
was displayed, whatever was the cause
of his own victory and the Papal pallium.
He came then from the election, the vessel,
so that he may strengthen that faith,
which is the beginning of the path to salvation.
But how do I go? Who allows?
For I am neither Aeneas nor Paul;
Neither another deems me worthy, nor do I judge.
If, therefore, I nod in agreement to come,
I fear lest I dare a foolish deed.
You are wise and observe, if I speak well.
Just as if someone who no longer wants what he wished,
and changing his mind through new aims,
he abandons the action he began.
I was such on the gloomy cliff;
For, reflecting, I turned away from what I began
of an undertaking with so much eagerness.
"If I understood rightly what was spoken by you,"
the shadow of the great-hearted answered,
"fear deprived your soul.
Who often oppresses man in such a way,
so that he turns away from every noble deed,
as a false sight wearies the horse.
For relief from your fear,
I’ll tell you, why I came and what I’ve learned in this way,
when I was first burdened by labors upon your [sufferings].
Being among these celestial beings,
a beautiful and blessed woman calls me,
of whom I eagerly asked for her commands.
With eyes more radiating than the stars,
she began to speak kindly and sweetly,
addressing me with an angelic voice.”—
—"O favored soul of Mantua,
of which glory still endures on the land,
and will remain as long as everything is in motion.
A certain friend of mine, but not a friend of fortune,
is hindered in such a way in deserted places
by the road so that he turns backward from fear.
And fearing lest he was already led astray,
and I came slowly towards incitement,
as I heard in the heavens about this.
Come now, take action with your favorable conditions
in all ways by which you can be saved.
Help yourself, and become a collaborator to me.
I am Beatrix, and I send you:
I come from here to return what is longed for to me.
A love potion moved me and inspires words.
When I will be in the presence of my Lord,
I will often speak well about you to Him."—
— "She indeed was silent, but I began."
"O lady, possessor of the only gift,
through which the human race pours forth,
the race of all in the lesser heaven.
In this way, your command is pleasing to me,
so that immediately, yielding, I seem to be slow.
You do not need to explain your commands.
But tell me, how did you descend here,
in this humble center, having left
the wide space, where you want to return?”—
—"Since you want to know everything in depth,
I will speak to you briefly," she said,
"So that I don't hesitate to descend here.
Everyone should fear only those things
which can cause harm to oneself.
But the other things: these are not to be feared.
I have become like this by divine grace,
so that the suffering of you does not harm me,
neither does the flame of this fire touch me.
In the heavens, the Lady is favorable,
having compassion for the man to whom I send you,
so that you may bend the hateful judgments above.
She, having summoned Lucius,
said, 'Now, your faithful one needs Him;
I fervently present Him to you.'"
"Lucius, the enemy of all hard-hearted,
immediately arose and came to the place where
I sat with Rachel, the ancient one.
He said, '”Beatrice, true divine praise,
how do you not help the one who has loved you,
and through you, having gone out of the crowd?
Do not you hear now his pitiful lamentations?
Do you not see him fighting with death
on a river more terrible than the sea?”’
"No one ever within the world, hunting for gain,
Or avoiding harm, ran so much,
As much as when I heard such words.
Here I came down from the blessed seat,
Having faith in speaking well of yours,
Which honors you and those who heard you.”—
—”Having said these, with tears in her eyes,
Turned towards me shining, and this,
Hastened my arrival here.
Having come from you, as she turned,
I saved you from the beast, which the mountain,
Prevented the beautiful approach to you.
What, therefore? Why, why are you staying?
How are you so unmanly in your heart?
How do you neither have courage nor boldness?
In which such three blessed Ladies
In the heavens above you are concerned,
And do we promise good words to you?”
Just as a flower from a frosty place at night bends,
And remains closed; but with the rising of the sun,
Upon the stem, it opens and stands upright.
In this way, having refreshed myself, I felt,
And so much confidence came to me within,
So that I responded like a brave man.
“O friendly soul, my protector,
And you, kind-hearted, quickly obeying
To which her faithful words encouraged you!
So in your exhortations within the heart,
You inserted a desire in me to proceed,
So that I returned back to the first purpose.
Come then, let there be one will for us;
You guide me, you are the master, and you are the ruler.”
I said these to him, and then he proceeded.
But I entered into the wild road.
