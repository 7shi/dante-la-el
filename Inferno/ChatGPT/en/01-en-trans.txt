In the middle of the journey of our life,
I found myself in a dark forest,
because the straight way had been lost.
Ah, how hard it is to tell what that forest was,
that wild and rough and strong forest
that renews the fear in the thought!
So bitter it is that death is hardly more so;
but to treat of the good that I found there,
I will tell of the other things I saw there.
I do not know well how I entered there,
so full of sleep was I at that point
when I abandoned the true way.
But after I was come to the foot of a hill,
there where the valley terminated,
which had pierced my heart with fear,
I looked up and saw his shoulders
already clothed with the rays of the planet
that guides others straight along every path.
Then the fear was a little quieted,
which had lasted in the lake of my heart
the night I spent with so much pity.
And like one who, with weary breath,
has come out of the sea onto the shore,
turns to the perilous water and gazes,
so my soul, which still was fleeing,
turned around to look back at the path
that never let any living person escape.
After I had rested my weary body a little,
I resumed the journey along the deserted shore,
so that my firm foot was always the lower one.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a light and very swift she-wolf,
that was covered with spotted fur;
and it did not depart from before my face,
indeed, it hindered so much my path,
that I was forced to turn back several times.
The time was the beginning of the morning,
and the sun was ascending with those stars
that were with it when divine love
first set those beautiful things in motion;
so that the bright season and the pleasant time
gave me occasion to hope well
about that beast with the speckled skin;
but not so much that the sight of a lion
did not give me fear.
He seemed to come against me,
with head held high and with ravenous hunger,
so that it seemed that the air trembled with it.
And a she-wolf, which in all desires
seemed burdened in her thinness,
and had already made many people live in misery,
she gave me so much heaviness
with the fear that came from her sight,
that I lost the hope of reaching the height.
And as one who gladly gains,
and reaches the time that makes him lose,
in all his thoughts weeps and becomes sad;
so the beast without peace made me,
which, coming against me, little by little
pushed me back to where the sun is silent.
While I was falling to a low place,
before my eyes appeared
someone who, through long silence, seemed weak.
When I saw him in the great desert,
"Have mercy on me," I cried to him,
"whoever you are, shade or real man!"
He answered me: "Not a man, though I was once a man,
and my relatives were Lombards,
both Mantuans by homeland.
I was born under Julius, though it was late,
and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus
in the time of the false and deceitful gods.
I was a poet, and I sang of that righteous
son of Anchises who came from Troy,
after proud Ilium was burned.
But why do you return to such trouble?
Why do you not climb the delightful mountain
that is the beginning and cause of all joy?"
"Now are you that Virgil and that source
that pours forth so broad a river of speech?"
I answered him with a shamefaced brow.
"O honor and light of the other poets,
let the long study and the great love
that made me search your volume avail me.
You are my teacher and my author,
you alone are the one from whom I took
the beautiful style that has brought me honor.
See the beast for which I turned back;
help me from her, famous sage,
for she makes my veins and pulses tremble."
"You must take a different journey,"
he replied, seeing me weep,
"if you wish to escape from this wild place;
for this beast, for which you cry out,
does not allow anyone to pass along its way,
but hinders him so much that it kills him;
and it has a nature so evil and malicious,
that it never satisfies its greedy desire,
and after the meal, it is hungrier than before.
Many are the animals with whom it mates,
and there will be more still, until the greyhound
comes, which will make her die in pain.
He will not feed on land or metal,
but on wisdom, love, and virtue,
and his nation will be between felt and felt.
From that humble Italy, salvation will come
for which the virgin Camilla died,
and Eurialus, Turnus, and Nisus from wounds.
He will chase her through every town,
until he has thrust her back into Hell,
from where envy first set her loose.
Therefore, I think and discern better for your sake,
that you follow me, and I will be your guide,
and lead you from here to the eternal place;
where you will hear the desperate cries,
you will see the ancient suffering spirits,
who cry out for the second death;
and you will see those who are content
in the fire because they hope to come
whenever it may be, to the blessed people.
To which, if you wish to ascend,
there will be a soul more worthy than I:
with her, I will leave you when I depart;
for the Emperor who reigns there above,
because I was rebellious to his law,
does not want anyone to come to his city for me.
He rules everywhere and governs there;
there is his city and his lofty throne:
oh, happy is the one whom he chooses there!"
And I to him: "Poet, I entreat you
by that God whom you did not know,
so that I may escape this evil and worse,
that you lead me to where you spoke of,
so that I may see the gate of Saint Peter
and those whom you make so mournful."
Then he moved, and I kept pace with him.
