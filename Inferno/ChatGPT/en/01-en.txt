In the middle of the journey of our life
I found myself in a dark forest,
because the straight way was lost.
Alas, how hard it is to tell what that forest was
this wild and rough and strong forest
which renews fear in the thought!
So bitter that little is more death;
but to speak of the good that I found there,
I will tell of the other things that I have seen there.
I do not know how I entered there well,
so full of sleep at that point
that I abandoned the true way.
But then, when I reached the foot of a hill,
there where that valley was ending
that had made my heart pierced with fear,
I looked up and saw his shoulders
already dressed in the rays of the planet
that leads straight others through every street.
Then the fear was a little calmed,
which in the lake of my heart had endured
the night that I passed with so much pity.
And like those who, with exhausted breath,
having come out of the sea onto the shore,
turns to the perilous water and watches,
thus, my soul, which still was fleeing,
turned itself backward to look at the step
that had never left any person alive.
Then, after I had rested my weary body a little,
I resumed the journey through the deserted shore,
so that the steady foot was always the lower one.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a light and very swift lynx,
that was covered with spotted fur;
and it was not leaving me in front of its face,
rather, it hindered so much my path,
that I was turned back many times.
It was time from the beginning of the morning,
and the sun was rising up with those stars
that were with him when divine love
moved those beautiful things at first;
so that a good cause for hope was to me
of that beast with the sleek skin.
the hour of the time and the sweet season;
but not so that fear did not give me
the sight of a lion that appeared to me.
This one seemed to be coming against me
with a high head and with furious hunger,
so that it seemed that the air trembled because of it.
And a she-wolf, who, with all desires,
seemed loaded in her thinness,
and already made many people live bitterly,
this gave me so much heaviness,
with the fear that came from her sight,
that I lost the hope of the height.
And he who gains willingly,
and reaches the time that makes him lose it,
who in all his thoughts cries and becomes sad;
such did the beast without peace make me,
that, coming towards me, little by little
pushed me back to where the sun is silent.
While I was falling in a low place,
before my eyes, he presented himself
who, through long silence, seemed weak.
When I saw this one in the great desert,
"Have mercy on me," I cried to him,
"whoever you are, whether shade or certain man!".
He answered me: "I am not a man; I was once a man,
and my relatives were Lombards,
mantuans by homeland, both of them.
I was born under Julius, even though it was late,
and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus
during the time of the false and deceitful gods.
I was a poet, and I sang of that just one,
the son of Anchises who came from Troy,
after proud Ilion (Troy) was burned.
But why do you return to such trouble?
why don't you climb the delightful mountain,
which is the beginning and cause of all joy?"
"Now, are you that Virgil and that fountain
who pours forth such a wide river of speech?"
I replied to him with a shameful face.
"O honor and light of the other poets,
may your long study and great love
that has made me seek your volume.
You are my master and my author,
you alone are the one from whom I took
the beautiful style that has honored me.
See the beast for which I turned;
help me from her, famous sage,
for she makes my veins and my wrists tremble."
"To you, it is necessary to undertake another journey,"
he replied, after he saw me weeping,
"if you want to escape from this wild place;
because this beast, for which you cry,
does not allow others to pass through its way,
but hinders him so much that it kills him;
and has a nature so wicked and cruel,
that it never satisfies the eager desire,
and after the meal, it has more hunger than before.
Many are the animals to which it mates,
and more will be yet, until the greyhound
comes, which will make it die with pain.
This one will not feed on land or pewter,
but on wisdom, love, and virtue,
and his nation will be between felt and felt.
From that humble Italy will be salvation,
for whom the virgin Camilla died,
Eurialus and Turnus and Nisus from wounds.
He will drive her through every town,
until he has placed her back in hell,
from where envy first separates.
So that I think and discern for your sake,
that you follow me, and I will be your guide,
and lead you from here to eternal place;
where you will hear the desperate cries,
you will see the ancient suffering spirits,
who cry out for the second death;
and you will see those who are content
in the fire, because they hope to come
when it is to the blessed people.
To which, then, if you will want to ascend,
a soul will be more worthy of this than me;
with her, I will leave you in my departure;
because the emperor who reigns up there,
because I was rebellious against his law,
does not want that in his city one comes for me.
He rules in all parts and there he governs;
there is his city and the high seat:
oh, happy is the one whom he chooses there!
And I to him: "Poet, I implore you
by that God whom you did not know,
so that I may escape this evil and worse,
that you lead me there where you said,
so that I may see the gate of Saint Peter,
and those whom you make so sad".
Then he moved, and I kept close behind him.
