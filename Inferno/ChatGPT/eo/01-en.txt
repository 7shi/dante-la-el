In the middle of the journey of our life
I found myself in a dark forest,
because the right path was lost.
Alas! How hard it is to say what it was
this wild and rough and strong forest
that renews the fear in thought!
So much it is bitter that little is more death;
but in order to discuss of the good that I found there,
I will tell about the other things that I observed there.
I do not know well how I entered there,
so much it was full of sleep at that point
that I abandoned the true path.
But then when I arrived at the foot of a hill,
where that valley ended,
which had filled my heart with fear,
I looked up and saw his/her shoulders
already dressed with the rays of the planet
that leads others straight through every street.
Then the fear became a little calm,
that in the lake of my heart had lasted,
the night that I spent with so much pity.
And like those who with labored breath,
having emerged from the open sea to the shore,
turns to the perilous water and watches,
thus my soul, which still fled,
turned back to look at the step
that never left a living person.
Then after I had rested my weary body a little,
I resumed my way along the deserted shore,
so that the steady foot was always the lower one.
And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
a light and very nimble lynx,
that was covered with spotted fur;
and didn't leave me in front of its face,
instead it obstructed my path so much,
that I had to turn back multiple times.
Time was from the beginning of the morning,
and the sun was rising up with those stars
that were with him when the divine love
moved those beautiful things at first;
so that a good hope was the cause to me
of that beast with the sleek skin
the hour of time and the sweet season;
but not so that it didn't give me fear
the sight that appeared to me of a lion.
This one seemed to come against me
with its high head and with furious hunger,
so that it seemed the air was trembling from it.
And a she-wolf, which in all desires
seemed loaded in its thinness,
and had already made many people live wretchedly,
this offered me so much weightiness
with the fear that came from its sight,
that I lost the hope of the height.
And like one who willingly acquires,
and reaches the time when he causes it to be lost,
who in all his thoughts cries and becomes sad;
such the beast without peace made me,
that, coming towards me, little by little
pushed me there where the sun is silent.
While I was falling in a low place,
before my eyes was presented to me
one who, through long silence, seemed faint.
When I saw this man in the great desert,
"Have mercy on me," I cried out to him,
"whoever you may be, whether shade or certain man!"
I answered: "Not a man, I was once a man,
and my relatives were Lombards,
mantuan by homeland, both of them."
I was born under Julius, even though it was late,
and I lived in Rome under good Augustus
during the time of the false and deceitful gods.
I was a poet, and I sang of that just
son of Anchises who came from Troy,
after the proud Ilion was burned.
But why do you return to such trouble?
why don't you climb the delightful mountain
which is the beginning and cause of all joy?"
"Now are you that Virgil and that fountain
that pour forth such a wide river of speech?"
I answered him with a ashamed face.
"O honor and light of the other poets,
the long study and the great love avails me
that has made me search for your volume.
You are my master and my author,
you are the only one from whom I took
the beautiful style that has honored me.
See the beast because of which I turned;
help me from it, famous sage,
because it makes my veins and pulses tremble."
"To you it is necessary to undertake another journey,"
he answered, after he saw me weeping,
"if you want to escape from this wild place;"
because this beast, for which you cry,
does not let others pass through its way,
but hinders it so much that it kills them;
and has a nature so wicked and vile,
that it never fills the craving desire,
and after the meal has more hunger than before.
Many are the animals with which it mates,
and many more will be, until the greyhound
comes, which will make her die with sorrow.
This one will not feed on earth or pewter,
but on wisdom, love, and virtue,
and his nation will be between felt and felt.
From that humble Italy will come salvation,
for which the virgin Camilla died,
Euryalus and Turnus and Nisus with wounds.
This one will chase her through every town,
until he has placed her back in hell,
where envy was first separated.
Wherefore I think and understand myself through your
that you follow me, and I will be your guide,
and lead you from here to eternal place;
where you will hear the desperate cries,
you will see the ancient suffering spirits,
who in the second death each one cries;
and you will see those who are content
in the fire, because they hope to come
whenever it may be to the blessed people.
To the steps then if you will want to climb,
a soul will be more worthy of this than me:
with her I will leave you in my departure;
because that emperor who up there reigns,
because I was rebellious to his law,
he does not want that into his city through me one comes.
In all parts he reigns and there rules;
there is his city and the high throne:
oh fortunate is he whom there he chooses!".
And I to him: "Poet, I implore you
for that God whom you did not know,
so that I may escape this evil and worse,
lead me there where you said,
so that I may see the gate of Saint Peter
and those whom you make so sad.
Then he moved, and I followed him.
