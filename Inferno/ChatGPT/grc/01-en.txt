In the middle of the path of this life
I found myself in a certain dark grove;
For I strayed from the straight road.
Oh, how terrible to say how he was that one
The grove rough, wild and bushy,
Where the memory arouses the fear!
Truly, something is somewhat lesser bitter than death.
But whatever beautiful I found intending to say,
About the other things which I saw there, I will speak.
I do not have well to say how I ever entered;
Thus, dreaming I was in that moment,
According to which I departed from the true path.
But when I came to the feet of a certain hill,
Where was the end of that valley,
Which struck my heart with fear,
Lifting my eyes, I already saw the backs
Carrying the rays of her, of the wandering planet
Shedding light everywhere.
Then the fear ceased a little,
The one freezing the torrents of my heart,
That night in which I passed through horrors.
But as when someone heavily gasping outside
Of the sea, having come out onto the shore,
Turning towards the treacherous wave gazes at.
Thus my soul still escaping
Turning back, she looked at the passage,
Whom a living person left, not yet.
But giving some relief to my body,
I took up the road of the desert again,
So that the foot was stronger than the lower one.
But behold, almost at the beginning of the ascent,
A certain light and swiftest leopard,
Covered with a spotted skin.
Motionless stood in front of me,
And this much was hindering my progress,
So that I tried to turn back many times.
But it was the time when the morning was clearing,
And the sun was rising among the stars,
With which coexisted when the divine potion
Those beautiful things first stirred deeds.
And then revealed good hopes to me,
And the multicolored skin of the animal.
Time of spring and the day, morning;
But not in such a way, as not to become fearful to me,
From the sight of the appearing lion.
This seemed to charge at me,
Lofty, hungry, fiercely in this way,
So that it appeared to make the air shiver.
And a certain wolf, or full of all kinds of longings,
Seemed to be of every kind, being very lean,
And already nurtured many who contest in all things.
This made such a numbness in me,
Releasing fear from her eyes,
So that I despaired of reaching the summit.
But as if someone rejoicing in gains,
But, in the presence of the time of loss,
Is distressed in his thoughts and weeps.
Such an unyielding beast made me,
Which, gradually moving towards me,
Pushed me out, and there, the silent sun remains.
While I was lost in the depths, but,
Someone stood before my eyes,
Who, silent for a long time, seemed voiceless.
But as I saw him in such a wilderness,
I said, shouting out, "Have mercy on me,
„ What kind are you, a living man or some shadow."—
—"No longer a human," he said, "I was a human;
„ But my parents were Longobards to me,
„ And Mantuans were my homeland both;
„ I became late in July,
„ And in Rome, I lived under the favor of Augustus,
„ In times of false and deceitful gods.
„ I was a poet and I sang of the just,
„ Son of Anchises, who came from Troy,
„ When the famous Ilium was burnt down.
„ But how did you come here into this wilderness?
„ How did you not go up to the thyme-covered mountain,
„ The beginning and cause of all happiness?"—
—"Indeed, are you Virgil, that source,
„ From which flows a river of eloquence?"
I answered, bowing my head with reverence.
"O glory and radiance of the other poets,
„ May you be favorable to me, for your long book,
„ Greatly studied and highly esteemed.
„ You are a teacher to me, and you are a leader,
„ You alone, from whom I received
„ The beautiful form of honor and praise.
„ Behold the beast that drove me away.
„ Help me, wise and honored one,
„ For it causes fear and trembling in me."—
—"It is fitting for you to turn to another path,"
He answered while seeing me lamenting,
"So that you may depart from this wild earth.
„ For this beast, for which you call to others,
„ Doesn't allow its own path to be passed through,
„ But it wards off until it kills them.
„ Thus, it has acquired an inherently malevolent nature,
„ So that nothing satisfies its insatiable desires,
„ And having been more satiated than before, it hungers.
„ The animals, to which they mostly intermingle,
„ And more will be, until Lycothea
„ Having come, in dreadful suffering, kills her/it.
„ This one will not live in lands and gold,
„ But in virtue, affection, and wisdom.
„ He will have a lineage between two brothers,
„ And a savior will be of humble Italy,
„ For whom the daughter Camilla died,
„ Euryalus, Turnus, and Nisus in battles.
„ Therefore, this will drive her out of every city,
„ Until he sends her into Hades,
„ From where envy first led her out.
„ Hence, I think and judge in your best interest,
„ How it might be for me, and I will guide you,
„ And I will bring you through an eternal land,
„ There, you will hear unexpected wailings,
„ And you will see ancient spirits who endured,
„ Calling for the second death with cries.
„ And you will see those who, pleasingly,
„ Remain in the fire, expecting
„ Someday to ascend into the realm of the blessed.
„ To these, then, if you wish to ascend,
„ There is a soul of mine more worthy,
„ With whom I will leave you before I depart.
„ For an Emperor who rules from above,
„ As one who disregards his own laws,
„ Doesn’t want me to come to his city.
„ This is the king of all, the ruler of Heavens,
„ Where his city and divine throne are.
„ Oh, blessed is he, whom he selects there!"
And I to him: "Poet, I beg of you,
„ Beseeching you towards God, whom you did not know,
„ To flee this evil or worse than this.
„ Guide me now where you said,
„ So that I can see the door of Saint Peter,
„ And those whom you say are so miserable."
Then he moved, but I spoke.
