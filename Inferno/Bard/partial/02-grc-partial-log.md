    Ἡ μὲν ἡμέρα παρήρχετο, καὶ πάντα
    Ὁ μελανώδης ἀὴρ τἀπὶ γῆς ζῶντα

* **Ἡ μὲν ἡμέρα** - The day
* **παρήρχετο** - was passing
* **καὶ πάντα** - and everything

The day was passing, and everything
The dark air drove away the pains of living things on earth.
But I alone

**Explanation:**

The speaker is describing a scene in which the day is ending and the darkness is coming. The dark air is associated with the night, which is often seen as a time of rest and peace. The speaker says that the dark air drives away the pains of living things, which suggests that the night brings relief from the struggles of life. However, the speaker is the only one who is not experiencing this relief. They are still alone, even in the darkness.

This passage could be interpreted in a number of ways. It could be a description of a literal scene, or it could be a more symbolic representation of the speaker's inner state. In either case, the passage suggests that the speaker is feeling isolated and alone, even in the face of darkness and rest.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

I was preparing to bear the weight
Of both the journey and the mental pain,
Which my faithful memory will now describe.

In this translation, the word "πάθος" is translated as "pain" instead of "suffering." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the speaker is facing physical as well as emotional challenges.

    “Ὁδηγέ μου ποιητά,” λέγειν ἠρξάμην,

Before I proceed on the terrible journey."

In this translation, the word "ἀξίαν" is translated as "worth" instead of "ability." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the speaker is not only asking about their physical ability to complete the journey, but also about their moral and spiritual worth.

"You say that the grandfather of Silvius came,
Still being mortal, into the land of the gods,
Having the senses of a living man."

In this translation, the word "αἰσθήσεις" is translated as "senses" instead of "feelings." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the grandfather of Silvius was able to experience the land of the immortals in a way that was similar to how a living man would experience it.

The speaker is arguing that if the grandfather of Silvius was a truly good man, then he must have been loved and protected by the gods. This would explain how he was able to enter the land of the immortals while he was still mortal.

The speaker is also asking the poet-guide to explain where the grandfather of Silvius came from and where he went after he left the land of the immortals. The speaker is eager to learn more about this mysterious man.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"But if the enemy of all evil
Was kind to him, thinking good things that are great,
We will go out from him, of what and where,

In this translation, the word "καλὰ" is translated as "good things" instead of "great good." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the grandfather of Silvius was not only kind to others, but also had a positive impact on the world.

    „ Οὐ δοκεῖ τοῦτ' ἀπρεπὲς ἀνδρὶ φρονίμῳ.
    „ Αὐτὸς γὰρ Ῥώμης τῆς σεμνῆς καὶ τοῦ Κράτους
    „ ᾙρέθη πατὴρ ἐν Οὐρανῶν αἰθέρι·

* **τῆς σεμνῆς** - the august

**Explanation:**

The speaker is addressing a poet-guide, who is telling them a story about the grandfather of Silvius. The speaker is now convinced that the story is true.

The speaker argues that it is not improper for a wise man to believe in the gods. In fact, it is only natural for a wise man to believe in a higher power that is responsible for the order and beauty of the world.

The speaker also points out that the grandfather of Silvius was found to be the father of Rome in the ether of heaven. This suggests that the grandfather of Silvius was a divine being who was chosen by the gods to be the founder of Rome.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"This does not seem improper to a wise man.
For he himself was found to be the father of Rome the august and of the State, in the ether of heaven."

In this translation, the word "ἀπρεπὲς" is translated as "improper" instead of "unfitting." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the speaker is not only arguing that it is not wrong to believe in the gods, but also that it is actually appropriate for a wise man to do so.

    „ Ῥώμη δὲ καὶ τὸ Κράτος, ἵν' ὀρθῶς εἴπω,

The speaker argues that Rome and the State were destined to be a sacred place, a place where the divine and the human would meet. This is because Rome was founded by a divine being, the grandfather of Silvius.

The speaker also points out that the successor of Peter, the Pope, dwells in Rome. This suggests that the Pope is the representative of the divine on earth, and that Rome is the center of the Christian world.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"But Rome and the State, to speak correctly,
Were destined as a sacred place,
Where the successor of Peter dwells."

In this translation, the word "ἱερός" is translated as "sacred" instead of "holy." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the speaker is not only arguing that Rome and the State are a special place, but also that they are a place of worship.

    „ Ἐκ τῆς πορείας, ἣν ἐξύμνησας, ταύτης

The speaker also points out that the papal cloak is a symbol of the power and authority of the pope. The grandfather of Silvius' victory over the forces of evil and his subsequent rise to the papacy were both made possible by his journey to the land of the immortals.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"From the journey you mentioned, this
He prepared beforehand whatever was the cause
Of his own victory and the papal cloak."

In this translation, the word "προκατέμαθεν" is translated as "prepared beforehand" instead of "prepared for." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the grandfather of Silvius was not only prepared for his victory, but also that he took steps to ensure that it would happen.

The speaker argues that the grandfather of Silvius was chosen by God to be the founder of the papacy. He was the vessel of election, the one who was chosen to carry on the work of God in the world.

The speaker also points out that the grandfather of Silvius strengthened the faith of the people. He taught them about the true nature of God and the meaning of salvation. This faith was the beginning of the saving race, the people who would be saved through the work of the Church.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"Then there came the vessel of election,
So that he might strengthen that faith,
Which is the beginning of the saving race."

In this translation, the word "σκεῦος" is translated as "vessel" instead of "instrument." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the grandfather of Silvius was not only a tool of God, but also a living being who was chosen by God for a special purpose.

    „ Ἀλλ' ἐγὼ πῶς ὑπάγω; τίς τ' ἐπιτρέπει;
    „ Οὔκ εἰμι γὰρ Αἰνείας, οὐδέ γε Παῦλος·
    „ Οὔτ' ἄλλος ἔμ' ἄξιον, οὔτ' ἐγὼ κρίνω.

Here is the phrase-by-phrase translation of the passage you provided:

**“ Ἀλλ' ἐγὼ πῶς ὑπάγω; τίς τ' ἐπιτρέπει;**

* **“ Ἀλλ'** - but
* **ἐγὼ** - I
* **πῶς** - how
* **ὑπάγω** - shall I go?
* **τίς** - who
* **τ'** - and
* **ἐπιτρέπει** - permits?

**“ Οὔκ εἰμι γὰρ Αἰνείας, οὐδέ γε Παῦλος;**

* **εἰμι** - I am
* **γὰρ** - for
* **Αἰνείας** - Aeneas
* **οὐδέ γε** - nor

* **Οὔτ'** - not
* **ἄλλος** - anyone else
* **ἔμ'** - me
* **ἄξιον** - worthy
* **οὔτ'** - nor

* **κρίνω** - judge

**Translation:**

"But how shall I go? Who permits it?
For I am not Aeneas, nor Paul;
Neither does anyone else judge me worthy, nor do I judge myself."

**Explanation:**

The speaker is a young man who is being called to a great mission. He is hesitant to accept this mission, because he feels unworthy. He is not like the great figures of the past, such as Aeneas and Paul. He does not feel that he is capable of fulfilling this mission.

The speaker also questions whether he is being called by God. He is not sure if he is worthy of God's favor. He is afraid of failing and being judged unworthy.

This passage is a reflection of the doubts and fears that often accompany a calling from God. It is a reminder that even the most worthy people can feel unworthy. However, God's call is always a gift, and it is important to trust in God's grace.

Here is a more literal translation of the passage:

"But how shall I go? And who permits it?
For I am not Aeneas, nor Paul;
Neither does anyone else judge me worthy, nor do I judge myself."

In this translation, the word "ἄξιον" is translated as "worthy" instead of "fit." This is a more literal translation, but it also suggests that the speaker is not only questioning his ability to fulfill the mission, but also his worth as a person.
