Then, when I had rested my weary body a little,
I resumed my way along the deserted shore,
So that my right foot was always the lowest.

In this passage, Dante is describing how he began to ascend the mountain of Hell. He had been overcome with fear and despair, but after resting for a while, he found the courage to continue on his journey. He walked along the shore of the river Acheron, which separates the living from the dead. As he walked, he kept his right foot on the ground, as if to remind himself that he was still alive.

**English translation:**

And behold, almost at the beginning of the slope,
A leopard light and very quick,
That was covered with spotted fur;

This passage describes the first of the three beasts that Dante encounters on his journey through Hell. The leopard is a symbol of lust, and its appearance represents the temptation that Dante must overcome in order to continue his journey. The leopard is described as being light and quick, which suggests that it is difficult to resist. The spotted fur also suggests that lust is a complex and multifaceted sin.

**English translation:**

And it did not part from before my face,
Instead it prevented my journey so much,
That I was about to turn back many times.

In this passage, Dante describes how the leopard prevented him from continuing his journey. The leopard was so close to Dante that it blocked his path. This suggests that lust is a powerful temptation that can be difficult to resist. Dante was even tempted to turn back and give in to his lust.

The phrase "più volte vòlto" can be translated as "many times turned." This suggests that Dante was tempted to turn back on multiple occasions. It also suggests that he struggled with his desire for lust.

This passage describes the time of day when Dante begins his journey through Hell. It was early in the morning, and the sun was rising. This suggests that Dante's journey is a new beginning, and that he is hopeful for the future. The stars that accompany the sun are a symbol of hope and guidance. They suggest that Dante will not be alone on his journey, and that he will have divine assistance.

The phrase "l'amor divino" can be translated as "the divine love." This is a reference to God's love, which is the source of Dante's journey.

This passage continues the description of the time of day when Dante begins his journey through Hell. The beautiful things that Dante refers to are the rising sun and the accompanying stars. These things gave Dante hope for the future and helped him to overcome the temptation of the leopard.

The phrase "di quella fiera a la gaetta pelle" can be translated as "of that beast with the gay skin." This refers to the leopard, which is a symbol of lust. The fact that the leopard's skin is "gay" suggests that it is attractive and tempting. However, Dante's hope for the future helped him to resist the temptation of the leopard.

**Translation:**

The hour of the time and the sweet season;
But not so much that fear did not give me
The sight that appeared to me of a lion.

This passage continues the description of Dante's journey through Hell. The hour of the time and the sweet season are a reference to the beautiful things that Dante saw at the beginning of his journey. These things gave him hope for the future, but they were not enough to overcome the fear that he felt when he saw the lion.

The phrase "la vista che m'apparve d'un leone" can be translated as "the sight that appeared to me of a lion." This refers to the second of the three beasts that Dante encounters on his journey through Hell. The lion is a symbol of pride, and its appearance represents the temptation that Dante must overcome in order to continue his journey.

The word "paura" can be translated as "fear." This suggests that Dante was deeply afraid of the lion. The lion is a powerful and dangerous animal, and it is a symbol of a sin that Dante struggled with in his own life.

**Translation:**

> This one seemed to come against me
> With his head high and angry hunger,
> So that it seemed that the air trembled.

This passage describes the appearance of the lion. The lion is described as having a high head and angry hunger. This suggests that the lion is arrogant and aggressive. The phrase "sì che parea che l'aere ne tremesse" can be translated as "so that it seemed that the air trembled." This suggests that the lion's presence was so powerful that it even caused the air to tremble.

The lion's appearance represents the temptation of pride. Pride is a powerful sin that can lead to arrogance and aggression. Dante was deeply afraid of the lion, and this fear represented his own struggle with pride.

    49 Ed una lupa, che di tutte brame

| viver | vivere | live |
| grame | gramo | miserable |

**Translation:**

> And a she-wolf, that seemed laden with all desires
> In her leanness, and made many people live miserably,

This passage describes the third and final beast that Dante encounters on his journey through Hell. The she-wolf is a symbol of avarice, and its appearance represents the temptation that Dante must overcome in order to continue his journey.

The phrase "di tutte brame" can be translated as "of all desires." This suggests that the she-wolf is driven by greed and selfishness. The phrase "in la sua magrezza" can be translated as "in her leanness." This suggests that the she-wolf is a powerful and dangerous animal, even though she is thin. The phrase "e molte genti fé già viver grame" can be translated as "and made many people live miserably." This suggests that the she-wolf has caused great suffering in the world.

Dante's encounter with the she-wolf represents his own struggle with avarice. Avarice is a powerful sin that can lead to greed, selfishness, and even violence. Dante's fear of the she-wolf represents his own fear of giving in to his own avarice.

    This is the line-by-line translation. Have you noticed anything?
    And a she-wolf, that with all desires
    seemed laden in the her leanness,
    and many people made already live miserable,

Yes, I noticed that the translation of the line "che di tutte brame sembiava carca ne la sua magrezza" is slightly different in the two versions. The first version translates "carca" as "laden with," while the second version translates it as "seemed laden in."

I believe that the second version is more accurate, because it captures the ambiguity of the Italian word "carca." "Carca" can mean both "laden" and "heavy." In the context of this passage, I think it is more likely that Dante is saying that the she-wolf is "heavy with all desires." This is because the she-wolf is a symbol of avarice, and avarice is a sin that is characterized by a heavy burden of desire.

The translation "seemed laden in" also captures the sense of mystery and danger that is associated with the she-wolf. The she-wolf is a powerful and dangerous animal, and her presence fills Dante with fear. The fact that she is "heavy with all desires" makes her even more threatening.

Overall, I think that the second version of the translation is more accurate and expressive. It captures the ambiguity and mystery of the Italian text, and it conveys the sense of danger that Dante felt when he encountered the she-wolf.

This passage is describing the feeling of loss and regret. The speaker is comparing himself to someone who has lost something they valued. The use of the word "volentieri" (willingly) suggests that the loss was unexpected or unwanted. The speaker's thoughts are filled with sadness and regret.

Translation:

Such made me the beast without peace,
That coming towards me, little by little,
Pushed me back there where the sun is silent.

The speaker is describing the beast as a symbol of fear and despair. The beast is "without peace" and it pushes the speaker back to a place where the sun is silent, suggesting a place of darkness and death.

This passage is also significant because it introduces the theme of the journey. The speaker is being pushed back by the beast, but he continues to move forward. This suggests that the speaker is on a journey of self-discovery and that he will have to face many challenges along the way.

This passage introduces the character of Virgil, who will be Dante's guide through Hell. Virgil is described as being "weak from long silence," suggesting that he has been in Hell for a long time. This also suggests that Virgil has a lot of knowledge and experience, which will be valuable to Dante on his journey.

| 64 | Quando vidi costui nel gran diserto, | When I saw this one in the great desert, |
| 65 | "Miserere di me", gridai a lui, | "Have mercy on me," I cried to him, |
| 66 | "qual che tu sii, od ombra od omo certo!". | "whether you are a shadow or a certain man!". |

In these lines, Dante is describing his first encounter with Virgil. He is overwhelmed with fear and despair, and he cries out to Virgil for mercy. He is not sure if Virgil is a shadow or a living man, but he is desperate for help.

The word "diserto" (desert) is significant because it suggests a place of isolation and despair. Dante is in a dark and lonely place, and he is feeling hopeless. The word "miserere" (have mercy) is also significant because it is a plea for help and compassion. Dante is asking Virgil for help to escape from Hell.

| 69 | mantoani per patrïa ambedui." | both from Mantua." |

**Translation:**

He replied to me, "Not a man, but a man I once was,
And my parents were Lombards,
Both from Mantua."

In these lines, Virgil reveals his identity to Dante. He tells Dante that he was once a man, and that his parents were from Mantua in Lombardy. This is a significant passage because it establishes Virgil as a credible guide for Dante. Virgil is a scholar and a poet, and he has a deep understanding of the human condition. He is also familiar with the geography of Hell, which will be essential for Dante's journey.

The word "patrïa" (homeland) is significant because it suggests that Virgil is connected to the place where he was born. This suggests that Virgil has a strong sense of identity and belonging. The word "ambedui" (both) is also significant because it suggests that Virgil's parents were close. This suggests that Virgil grew up in a loving and supportive family.

    I add "homeland" in translation.
    He replied to me, "Not a man, but a man I once was,
    And my parents were Lombards,
    Both from homeland Mantua."

Thank you for providing the context. I will use it to improve my responses in the future.

I understand that you have added the word "homeland" in your translation of line 68. I think this is a good addition, as it emphasizes Virgil's connection to the place where he was born. It also suggests that Virgil is a man with a strong sense of identity and belonging.

Here is a revised summary table:

| Line Number | Italian line | English line |
|---|---|---|

| 71 | e vissi a Roma sotto ’l buono Augusto | and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus |
| 72 | nel tempo de li dèi falsi e bugiardi. | in the time of the false and lying gods. |

These lines provide some additional information about Virgil's life. He was born in Mantua under the rule of Julius Caesar, but he lived most of his life in Rome during the reign of Augustus. This was a time of great peace and prosperity for the Roman Empire, and it was also a time of great cultural flourishing. Virgil was one of the leading poets of his day, and his work is still studied and admired today.

The phrase "nel tempo de li dèi falsi e bugiardi" (in the time of the false and lying gods) is significant because it suggests that Virgil was aware of the limitations of pagan religion. He lived in a time when people worshipped many different deities, but he knew that these gods were not real. This suggests that Virgil was a man of great intellect and insight.

| 74 | figliuol d’Anchise che venne di Troia, | son of Anchises who came from Troy, |
| 75 | poi che ’l superbo Ilïón fu combusto. | after proud Ilium was burned. |

In these lines, Virgil identifies himself as the author of the Aeneid, an epic poem about the Trojan hero Aeneas. Aeneas is described as a "just" man, and Virgil's poem tells the story of his journey from Troy to Italy, where he becomes the ancestor of the Roman people.

The phrase "'l superbo Ilïón fu combusto" (proud Ilium was burned) is significant because it refers to the destruction of Troy at the end of the Trojan War. This was a major event in classical mythology, and it is still remembered today as a symbol of the fragility of human civilization.

**Translation:**

But you, why do you return to so much boredom?
Why don't you climb the delightful mountain
That is the beginning and cause of all joy?"

In these lines, Virgil asks Dante why he is returning to Hell. He suggests that Dante should be climbing Mount Purgatory, which is the path to salvation.

The phrase "tanta noia" (so much boredom) is significant because it suggests that Hell is a place of great suffering and despair. Dante is overwhelmed with fear and guilt, and he is not sure how to escape from Hell.

The phrase "il dilettoso monte" (the delightful mountain) is also significant because it suggests that Mount Purgatory is a place of hope and redemption. Dante can find salvation by climbing the mountain and facing his sins.

The phrase "principio e cagion di tutta gioia" (beginning and cause of all joy) is a reference to God. Dante can find true joy only by returning to God.

**Translation:**

"Now are you that Virgil and that fountain
That spreads of speaking so wide river?"
I replied to him with ashamed forehead.

In these lines, Dante expresses his awe and admiration for Virgil. He calls Virgil "quel Virgilio" (that Virgil), which suggests that he is referring to the famous poet of ancient Rome. He also calls Virgil "quella fonte" (that fountain), which suggests that Virgil is a source of great wisdom and inspiration.

The phrase "di parlar sì largo fiume" (of speaking so wide river) is significant because it suggests that Virgil's poetry is vast and profound. Virgil's work is a treasure trove of knowledge and insight, and it has inspired generations of readers.

The phrase "con vergognosa fronte" (with ashamed forehead) suggests that Dante is humble in the presence of Virgil. He is aware of his own shortcomings, and he is grateful for Virgil's guidance.

**Translation:**

"O honor and light of the other poets,
May the long study and the great love
That has made me seek your volume
Be of use to me."

In these lines, Dante addresses Virgil as "O de li altri poeti onore e lume" (O honor and light of the other poets). This is a high compliment, and it suggests that Dante considers Virgil to be one of the greatest poets of all time.

Dante then asks Virgil for help. He says that he has studied Virgil's work for many years, and he loves it deeply. He believes that Virgil can help him to understand the meaning of his journey through Hell.

The phrase "che m’ ha fatto cercar lo tuo volume" (that has made me seek your volume) is significant because it suggests that Dante's love of Virgil's poetry is a driving force in his journey. Dante is motivated by his desire to understand Virgil's work, and he believes that Virgil can help him to find salvation.

**Translation:**

"You are my teacher and my author,
You are only he from whom I took
The beautiful style that has made me honor."

In these lines, Dante expresses his deep gratitude to Virgil. He says that Virgil is his teacher and his inspiration. He owes his success as a poet to Virgil's guidance and instruction.

The phrase "lo bello stilo che m’ ha fatto onore" (the beautiful style that has made me honor) is significant because it suggests that Dante's style is a reflection of Virgil's influence. Dante's poetry is elegant and graceful, and it is full of wisdom and insight. This is due in large part to Virgil's teaching.

The lines "Tu se’ lo mio maestro e ’l mio autore" (You are my teacher and my author) are particularly important. They establish the relationship between Dante and Virgil as one of teacher and student. Virgil is the guide and mentor who will lead Dante through his journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.

**Translation:**

"See the beast for whom I turned;
Help me from her, famous wise man,
For she makes me tremble my veins and wrists."

In these lines, Dante is begging Virgil for help. He is terrified of the beast, and he knows that he cannot defeat it on his own. He is asking Virgil to use his wisdom and power to protect him.

The phrase "famoso saggio" (famous wise man) is significant because it shows that Dante has great respect for Virgil. He believes that Virgil is the only one who can help him escape from Hell.

The phrase "mi fa tremar le vene e i polsi" (makes me tremble my veins and wrists) is also significant because it shows how frightened Dante is of the beast. The beast is so powerful and terrifying that it makes Dante's entire body tremble.

These lines are important because they show Dante's vulnerability and his need for help. Dante is not a perfect hero; he is a man who is struggling with his own sins and fears. However, he is willing to humble himself and ask for help when he needs it.

| 93 | "se vuo’ campar d’esto loco selvaggio; | "if you wish to live in this savage place; |

**Translation:**

"It is necessary for you to take another journey,"
He replied, when he saw me weeping,
"if you wish to live in this savage place;

In these lines, Virgil tells Dante that he must take a different path if he wants to escape from Hell. The path that Dante is currently on is leading him to destruction.

The phrase "loco selvaggio" (savage place) is significant because it suggests that Hell is a place of great danger and suffering. Dante is surrounded by sinners who are being punished for their sins. He must find a way to escape from this place if he wants to be saved.

The lines "se vuo’ campar d’esto loco selvaggio" (if you wish to live in this savage place) are particularly important. They establish the stakes of Dante's journey. Dante must either find a way to escape from Hell, or he will be lost forever.

| 95 | non lascia altrui passar per la sua via, | does not let anyone pass through its way, |
| 96 | ma tanto lo ’mpedisce che l’uccide; | but so much it prevents him that it kills him; |

**Translation:**

"Because this beast, for which you cry,
Does not let anyone pass through its way,
But so much it prevents him that it kills him;"

In these lines, Virgil explains to Dante that the beast he is afraid of is a dangerous creature that will not let anyone pass through its way. The beast is a symbol of sin and temptation, and it represents the obstacles that Dante must overcome in order to find salvation.

The phrase "la sua via" (its way) is significant because it suggests that the beast is in control of its own destiny. The beast is not bound by the same rules as humans, and it can do whatever it wants. This makes it a formidable opponent for Dante.

The phrase "ma tanto lo ’mpedisce che l’uccide" (but so much it prevents him that it kills him) is also significant because it suggests that the beast is deadly. The beast is not just a nuisance; it is a threat to Dante's life. Dante must be careful not to let the beast catch him.

| 99 | e dopo ’l pasto ha più fame che pria. | and after the meal it has more hunger than before. |

**Translation:**

"And it has a nature so wicked and evil,
That it never fills the greedy desire,
And after the meal it has more hunger than before."

In these lines, Virgil further describes the beast as a creature with a wicked and insatiable nature. The beast is always hungry, and it is never satisfied. This makes it a particularly dangerous opponent for Dante, who is already struggling with his own sins and temptations.

The phrase "la bramosa voglia" (the greedy desire) is significant because it suggests that the beast is driven by its own desires. The beast is not motivated by reason or morality; it is simply driven by its own hunger for power and destruction.

The phrase "e dopo ’l pasto ha più fame che pria" (and after the meal it has more hunger than before) is also significant because it suggests that the beast's hunger is insatiable. The beast can never be satisfied, and it will always be a threat to Dante and anyone else who stands in its way.

**Summary:** The poet describes the many creatures that the she-wolf resembles, and says that there will be even more until the greyhound comes, who will kill the she-wolf with pain. This is a prophecy of the coming of a savior who will defeat evil.

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil is describing the qualities of the greyhound, who will come to defeat the she-wolf. The greyhound will not be motivated by material wealth, but by wisdom, love, and virtue. He will come from a humble background, "between felt and felt."

The greyhound is a symbol of hope for Dante. He represents the possibility of a better future for Italy, one free from the corruption and violence of the time.

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil is continuing his description of the greyhound, who will come to defeat the she-wolf. He says that the greyhound will be the salvation of Italy, which has been suffering from corruption and violence.

The greyhound is a symbol of hope for Dante. He represents the possibility of a better future for Italy, one free from the corruption and violence of the time.

The specific references to Camilla, Eurialo, Turnus, and Nisus are also significant. These are all figures from Italian history and mythology who died in battle. They represent the many people who have sacrificed their lives for Italy.

Dante is suggesting that the greyhound will be a new leader who will restore peace and order to Italy. He will be a man of wisdom, love, and virtue, and he will come from a humble background.

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil continues his description of the greyhound, who will come to defeat the she-wolf. He says that the greyhound will chase the she-wolf through every town in Italy, until he has sent her back to hell, where she came from.

This is a powerful image of the greyhound as a force for good in the world. He will be a champion of justice and order, and he will defeat the forces of evil that have been plaguing Italy.

The reference to envy is also significant. Envy is often seen as a destructive force, and it is often associated with the she-wolf. The greyhound's victory over the she-wolf will represent the triumph of good over evil, and the defeat of envy.

| 114 | e trarrotti di qui per loco etterno; | and I will draw you from here through eternal place; |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil tells Dante that he must follow him if he wants to be saved. He will be Dante's guide through the Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradiso.

The phrase "per lo tuo me'" can be translated as "for your own sake." This suggests that Dante must follow Virgil for his own good, not for Virgil's. He must make the journey to the afterlife in order to save himself.

The phrase "e trarrotti di qui per loco etterno" can be translated as "and I will draw you from here through eternal place." This suggests that the journey to the afterlife will be a difficult one. Dante will be leaving the familiar world of the living and entering a new and unknown world. Virgil will be there to help him through this journey.

These lines are significant because they mark the beginning of Dante's journey. They also introduce Virgil as Dante's guide and mentor.

| 117 | ch’a la seconda morte ciascun grida; | that each cries out to the second death; |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil describes what Dante will see and hear in the Inferno. He will hear the desperate cries of the damned, who are suffering in eternal torment. He will see the ancient spirits, who have been punished for their sins. They are all sorrowful and regretful of their past actions.

The phrase "la seconda morte" can be translated as "the second death." This is a reference to the final judgment, when the damned will be condemned to hell for eternity. The cries of the damned are a reminder of the consequences of sin.

These lines are significant because they provide a glimpse of the horrors of the Inferno. They also foreshadow Dante's own journey of redemption.

| 120 | quando che sia a le beate genti | when that will be to the blessed people |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil continues to describe what Dante will see in the Inferno. He will see the souls of the lustful, who are punished by being burned in fire. However, these souls are not in despair. They are content, because they know that they will eventually be redeemed and join the blessed in heaven.

The phrase "quando che sia" can be translated as "when that will be." This suggests that the redemption of the lustful is not yet certain. They must still endure their punishment in fire, but they have hope for the future.

These lines are significant because they provide a glimpse of the possibility of redemption, even for those who have committed serious sins. They also foreshadow Dante's own journey of redemption, which will be completed in the Paradiso.

| 123 | con lei ti lascerò nel mio partire; | with her I will leave you in my departure; |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil tells Dante that he will not be able to guide him all the way to Paradise. There is a soul more worthy than he who will take over Dante's guidance.

The phrase "A le quai poi se tu vorrai salire" can be translated as "To which, then, if you will want to climb." This suggests that Dante will eventually reach Paradise, but that it will not be through Virgil's guidance.

The phrase "anima fia a ciò più di me degna" can be translated as "a soul will be more worthy of that than I." This suggests that the soul who will guide Dante to Paradise is a more virtuous and worthy soul than Virgil.

The phrase "con lei ti lascerò nel mio partire" can be translated as "with her I will leave you in my departure." This suggests that Virgil will be leaving Dante in the care of the other soul.

These lines are significant because they foreshadow Dante's ultimate redemption. They also suggest that Virgil is a flawed individual, even though he is a great poet and guide.

| 126 | non vuol che ’n sua città per me si vegna | does not want that one comes into his city through me |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil explains why he will not be able to guide Dante all the way to Paradise. He tells Dante that he was a rebel against God's law, and that God will not allow him to enter Heaven.

The phrase "ché quello imperador che là sù regna" can be translated as "because that emperor who reigns up there." This refers to God, the ruler of Heaven.

The phrase "perch’i’ fu’ ribellante a la sua legge" can be translated as "because I was rebellious to his law." This refers to Dante's sin of pride.

The phrase "non vuol che ’n sua città per me si vegna" can be translated as "does not want that one comes into his city through me." This suggests that God will not allow Dante to enter Heaven through Virgil's guidance.

These lines are significant because they reveal the personal nature of Dante's journey. They also suggest that Dante's redemption will require him to confront his own sinfulness.

| 129 | oh felice colui cu’ ivi elegge!". | Oh happy he whom He elects there!". |

**Summary:**

In these lines, Virgil concludes his explanation of why he will not be able to guide Dante all the way to Paradise. He reiterates that God is the ruler of Heaven, and that only those who are chosen by God will be allowed to enter.

The phrase "In tutte parti impera e quivi regge" can be translated as "In all parts He rules and there He reigns." This suggests that God's rule is universal and absolute.

The phrase "quivi è la sua città e l’alto seggio" can be translated as "There is His city and His high throne." This refers to Heaven, which is God's dwelling place.

The phrase "oh felice colui cu’ ivi elegge!" can be translated as "Oh happy he whom He elects there!" This is a cry of praise to God, who chooses those who will be saved.

These lines are significant because they reaffirm the importance of God's grace in the journey to salvation. They also suggest that Dante's redemption will ultimately be up to God.
