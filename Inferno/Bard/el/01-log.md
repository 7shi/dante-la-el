    2. Create a word-by-word table: column 1 for Italian, column 2 for English, column 3 for Modern Greek.
    
    Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita

    ché la diritta via era smarrita.

| via | path | διαδρομή |
| era | was | ήταν |
| smarrita | lost | χαμένη |

Please note that this is just a literal translation, and there may be more nuanced or poetic ways to translate some of the words and phrases. For example, the Italian word "selva" can also mean "wood" or "wilderness," and the English word "forest" can also mean "jungle." So, the translation of "selva oscura" could be "dark forest," "dark wood," or even "dark wilderness."

I hope this is helpful!

    For each line of the original text, connect the words from the immediately preceding table to form an English and Modern Greek sentence.

| Italian line | English | Modern Greek |

| Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita | In the middle of the journey of our life | Στο μέσο του ταξιδιού της ζωής μας |

| ché la diritta via era smarrita | because the straight path was lost | γιατί η ευθεία διαδρομή ήταν χαμένη |

| esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte | this wild, rough, and strong forest | αυτή η άγρια, τραχιά και δυνατή ζούγκλα |
| che nel pensier rinova la paura! | that in my thought renews the fear! | που στη σκέψη μου ανανεώνει τον φόβο! |

**Summary:**

Dante describes the forest he is lost in as wild, rough, and strong. He says that it is difficult to say what it was like, and that just thinking about it renews his fear.

This passage is a powerful description of the Inferno. Dante uses vivid imagery to create a sense of fear and foreboding. The forest represents the dangers and challenges that Dante will face on his journey through Hell.

This is the first of the three beasts that Dante encounters in the Inferno. It is a symbol of the sin of lust. The leopard's spotted fur represents the many different temptations that can lead to lust.

The English translation is as follows:

> And it did not part from before my face, but rather so hindered my journey that I was about to turn back many times.

The Modern Greek translation is as follows:

> Και δεν απομακρύνθηκε από μπροστά από το πρόσωπό μου, αλλά μάλλον εμπόδιζε τόσο το ταξίδι μου που ήμουν έτοιμος να γυρίσω πίσω πολλές φορές.

This passage describes how the leopard blocked Dante's path and prevented him from continuing his journey. This is a metaphor for how lust can prevent us from achieving our goals. The leopard's repeated attempts to block Dante's path represent the many temptations that can lead to lust.

| ch’eran con lui quando l’amor divino | that were with him when the divine love | που ήταν μαζί του όταν η θεϊκή αγάπη |

The English translation is as follows:

> It was the beginning of the morning, and the sun was rising with those stars that were with him when the divine love

The Modern Greek translation is as follows:

> Ήταν η αρχή του πρωινού, και ο ήλιος ανέβαινε με εκείνα τα αστέρια που ήταν μαζί του όταν η θεϊκή αγάπη

This passage describes the time of day when Dante begins his journey through the Inferno. The sun is rising, which is a symbol of hope and new beginnings. The stars that accompany the sun represent the divine love that guides Dante on his journey.

In addition to the literal translation, here is a more poetic interpretation of the passage:

> It was the dawn of a new day,
> and the sun was rising with the stars.
> The divine love was with him,
> guiding him on his journey.

This interpretation emphasizes the spiritual significance of the passage. The dawn represents a new beginning, and the sun and stars represent the divine love that guides Dante on his journey to salvation.

| mosse di prima quelle cose belle | moved first those beautiful things | κίνησε πρώτα εκείνα τα όμορφα πράγματα |
| sì ch’a bene sperar m’era cagione | so that it was a reason for me to hope well | έτσι που ήταν ένας λόγος για μένα να ελπίζω καλά |
| di quella fiera a la gaetta pelle | of that beast with the cheerful fur | από εκείνο το θηρίο με το χαρούμενο τρίχωμα |

The English translation is as follows:

> It moved first those beautiful things, so that it was a reason for me to hope well of that beast with the cheerful fur.

The Modern Greek translation is as follows:

> Κινήθηκε πρώτα εκείνα τα όμορφα πράγματα, έτσι που ήταν ένας λόγος για μένα να ελπίζω καλά για εκείνο το θηρίο με το χαρούμενο τρίχωμα.

This passage describes how the sight of the leopard gave Dante hope that he would be able to overcome the sin of lust. The leopard's cheerful fur is a symbol of the beauty of the natural world, which can inspire us to hope for redemption.

In addition to the literal translation, here is a more poetic interpretation of the passage:

> The first thing that moved me was the beauty of the world,
> which gave me hope that I could overcome my sins.

This interpretation emphasizes the spiritual significance of the passage. The beauty of the world is a reminder of God's love, which can help us to overcome our sinful nature.

The English translation of the whole stanza is:

> And a she-wolf, laden with all desires,
> seemed in its thinness,
> and had already made many people live miserably,

The Modern Greek translation of the whole stanza is:

> Και μια λύκαινα, φορτωμένη με όλες τις επιθυμίες,
> φαινόταν στη τη αδυναμία της,
> και είχε ήδη κάνει πολλούς ανθρώπους να ζουν άθλιους

This stanza describes the third beast that Dante encounters, the she-wolf. She is a symbol of the sin of avarice, or greed. Her thinness represents the insatiable nature of greed, and her many desires represent the many things that people can be greedy for. Dante says that the she-wolf has already made many people live miserably, which suggests that avarice is a very destructive sin.

The English translation of the whole stanza is:

> This gave me so much weight

> that I lost the hope of the height.

The Modern Greek translation of the whole stanza is:

> Αυτή μου έδωσε τόσο βάρος
> με τον φόβο που βγήκε από τη δική της όραση,
> που έχασα την ελπίδα του ύψους.

This stanza describes the effect that the she-wolf has on Dante. She is so terrifying that she fills him with fear, which weighs him down and makes it difficult for him to continue his journey. Dante says that he lost the hope of the height, which suggests that he lost hope of achieving salvation.

In a more figurative sense, this stanza can be interpreted as a description of the effect that sin can have on us. Sin can weigh us down with guilt and shame, making it difficult for us to live a good life. It can also make us lose hope of achieving our full potential.

| che ’n tutti suoi pensier piange e s’attrista | that in all his thoughts he cries and saddens | που σε όλες τις σκέψεις του κλαίει και λυπάται |

The English translation of the whole stanza is:

> And such is he who willingly acquires,
> and the time comes that makes him lose it,
> that in all his thoughts he cries and saddens.

The Modern Greek translation of the whole stanza is:

> Και τέτοιος είναι αυτός που πρόθυμα αποκτά,
> και έρχεται ο χρόνος που το κάνει να το χάσει,
> που σε όλες τις σκέψεις του κλαίει και λυπάται.

This stanza describes the effect that the loss of something precious can have on us. The speaker compares someone who loses something that they have acquired with someone who is grieving the loss of a loved one. They say that the person who loses something they have acquired will cry and be sad in all their thoughts.

In a more figurative sense, this stanza can be interpreted as a description of the effect that sin can have on us. When we sin, we lose something precious, namely our relationship with God. This loss can cause us great sadness and grief.

Here is a more poetic interpretation of the stanza:

> Like one who eagerly acquires,
> then loses all that he holds dear,
> so I, in all my thoughts,
> weep and grieve for what is no more.

This interpretation emphasizes the personal nature of the speaker's experience. The speaker is not simply describing a general phenomenon, but rather their own experience of loss. They are grieving the loss of something that they had acquired, perhaps a relationship, a dream, or a sense of purpose.

The Modern Greek translation of the whole stanza is:

> Τέτοιο έκανε το θηρίο χωρίς ειρήνη εμένα,
> που, ερχόμενος προς μένα, λίγο λίγο,
> με έσπρωξε πίσω εκεί όπου ο ήλιος σιωπά.

This stanza describes the effect that the she-wolf has on Dante. She is so terrifying that she makes him turn back from his journey. She pushes him back to the dark and gloomy world of sin, where the sun is silent.

In a more figurative sense, this stanza can be interpreted as a description of the effect that sin can have on us. Sin can lead us away from God and into a dark and hopeless place. It can make us lose hope of achieving our full potential.

Here is a more poetic interpretation of the stanza:

> The beast without peace pushed me back,
> little by little, to the dark,
> where the sun is silent.

This interpretation emphasizes the relentless nature of the she-wolf. She does not give up easily, and she will continue to push us back into sin until we are defeated.

> Ενώ έπεφτα σε ένα χαμηλό μέρος,
> μπροστά στα μάτια μου προσφέρθηκε
> αυτός που για μακρά σιωπή φαινόταν αδύναμος.

This stanza describes Dante's encounter with the shade of Virgil, the ancient Roman poet. Virgil has been waiting for Dante in the Inferno, and he is there to guide him on his journey. Dante describes Virgil as being weak, perhaps because he has been silent for so long. However, Virgil is also a wise and experienced guide, and Dante is grateful for his help.

In a more figurative sense, this stanza can be interpreted as a description of the encounter between the human soul and God. When we are lost in sin, God comes to us and offers us his guidance. He helps us to see the light and to find our way back to him.

> "Ελέησέ με", φώναξα στον αυτόν,

This stanza describes Dante's plea for mercy from Virgil. Dante is lost and afraid, and he sees Virgil as his only hope. He begs Virgil to help him, no matter who he is, whether he is a shadow or a real person.

In a more figurative sense, this stanza can be interpreted as a prayer to God. When we are lost and afraid, we can cry out to God for mercy. He is our only hope, and he will always help us, no matter what.

> Μου απάντησε: "Δεν είμαι άνθρωπος, ήμουν κάποτε άνθρωπος,
> και οι γονείς μου ήταν Λομβαρδοί, Μαντουάνοι και οι δύο από την πατρίδα τους."

In this stanza, Virgil reveals his identity to Dante. He tells Dante that he was once a real man, a poet from Mantua, Italy. Virgil's answer gives Dante hope, as it shows that he is not alone in his journey. Virgil is a guide who can help Dante to understand the Inferno and to find his way to salvation.

In a more figurative sense, Virgil's answer can be interpreted as a message of hope for all people. Even though we may feel lost and alone, there is always hope for redemption. God is always with us, and he will always help us to find our way back to him.

The English translation of the whole stanza is:

> I was born under Julius, even though it was late,
> and I lived in Rome under the good Augustus
> in the time of the false and lying gods.

The Modern Greek translation of the whole stanza is:

> Γεννήθηκα υπό τον Ιούλιο, ακόμα κι αν ήταν αργά,
> και έζησα στη Ρώμη υπό τον καλό Αύγουστο
> στον καιρό των ψευδών και ψεύτικων θεών.

In this stanza, Virgil continues to reveal his identity to Dante. He tells Dante that he was born in Rome under the reign of Julius Caesar and Augustus. Virgil also tells Dante that he lived in a time when the gods were false and lying.

This stanza can be interpreted in a number of ways. On one level, it is simply a historical statement about Virgil's life. On another level, it can be seen as a commentary on the nature of religion. Virgil is suggesting that the gods of his time were not true gods, but rather false and lying deities. This suggests that Virgil was a man of faith, and that he believed in a higher power that was beyond the gods of Rome.
