### Warning

Some corrections have been made, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed.

# Italian

For the convenience of learning Italian from English, I have created a text that juxtaposes Dante's original text with a line split version of the English translation by Norton.

* it-words

The word analysis is by Bard and the log is attached, but is riddled with errors. It can be used as a guide to word correspondence, but should not be trusted.

# English

I am comparing several different translations here, but it is quicker to look at the file below.

The comparison of Dante, Longfellow, Norton and Carlyle in Inferno Canto I and II.

## Norton

Norton's translation has already been converted to text.

* https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1995

Norton's translation is prose, but, as the author wrote, faithful to Dante's original. The preface describes the translation policy.

> I have tried to be as literal in my translation as was consistent with good English, and to render Danteâ€™s own words in words as nearly correspondent to them as the difference in the languages would permit. But it is to be remembered that the familiar uses and subtle associations which give to words their full meaning are never absolutely the same in two languages. Love in English not only SOUNDS but IS different from amor in Latin, or amore in Italian. Even the most felicitous prose translation must fail therefore at times to afford the entire and precise meaning of the original. 

### Line Split Version

I made two versions of Norton's translation with line breaks: a three-line version and a one-line version.

* en-norton-3
* en-norton-1

I first created a three-line version, which I used as the basis for a one-line version. The three-line version simply adds line breaks, but does not alter the text; the one-line version rearranges the word order to conform the content to Dante's original text, but does not otherwise rewrite the text.

The splitting process from a three-line version to a one-line version was done by Bard and the log is attached. Final corrections were made manually. It is only a division of prose and is not intended to be altered into poetry.

## Longfellow

As for the translation of three-line poems, Longfellow's translation is highly faithful to the original text, and I used to use it.

* https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1004

However, since some parts of the text differ from Dante's original when viewed line by line, I decided to modify Norton's translation.

## Carlyle

I thought Carlyle's literal translation was a suitable bridge to Italian. However, when I actually compared it to other translations, I decided that the wording was a bit dated and that Norton's was more appropriate.
