About the English translations included here.

## Norton

"en-norton" is a modified version of Norton's translation. It has already been converted to text.

Norton's translation is prose, but relatively faithful to Dante's original. In dividing the text into lines, it was needed to modify some of the word order so that the lines are consistent. The main work was done by Bard and the log is attached. Final corrections were made manually.

## Longfellow

For translations in three-line verses, Longfellow's translation is relatively faithful to the original text, and I used to use this.

* https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1004

However, since some parts of the text differ from Dante's original when viewed line by line, I decided to modify Norton's translation.
