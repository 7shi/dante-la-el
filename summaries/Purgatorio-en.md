# Purgatorio

Dante's Purgatorio is the second cantica in his epic poem the Divine Comedy, following Inferno and preceding Paradiso. As the title suggests, it depicts Dante's imaginative journey through Purgatory - the Christian realm in the afterlife where repentant souls undergo penance and purification of their sins before ascending to Paradise.

Virgil guides Dante on his journey up the mountain of Purgatory, representing the moral ascent toward spiritual perfection. At the bottom they pass through an ante-purgatory filled with souls who died violently or lacked the chance to properly repent. Further up are seven terraces where souls purge themselves of the seven deadly sins in order, from pride to lust. Dante witnesses their suffering and illustrative examples of virtue triumphing over vice as the penitents learn humility and moderation.

Along the way Dante converses with a number of deceased acquaintances and famous figures to learn their stories of sin, redemption through grace, and hope for salvation. He is reunited with his lost love Beatrice at the summit in the Earthly Paradise. She takes over as his guide for the final ascent, emphasizing moral duty and spiritual ideals. Her beauty and wisdom inspire Dante's transformation.

Purgatorio traces a path from moral confusion toward spiritual clarity, emphasizing the human potential for growth. Where Inferno exposed sin and corruption, Purgatorio finds redemption and healing. Its central theme is that sin results from misdirected love, while properly ordered love lifts one closer toward the divine. The corrected souls educate Dante in moral virtues and theology so that he may ascend purified.

The poem is structured as an allegory saturated with deeper philosophical, social and political significance. The trials of ascent represent internal struggles toward moral betterment as well as historical challenges facing Italy and the Church in Dante's tumultuous 14th century. The souls Dante meets symbolize various states of moral health tied to questions of society, faith, politics and humanity's purpose.

Purgatorio continues Dante’s exploration of evil, guilt, and suffering, while turning towardrepair and redemption. It is at once an intensely personal story about Dante's own path to spiritual enlightenment and a sweeping analysis of political dynamics, philosophical perspectives on free will, and the vision of history unfolding under divine oversight toward moral justice on both a personal and global scale.

- As night falls, Dante perceives it's past midnight on earth though evening in Purgatory. Suddenly a bright splendor dazzles Dante's sight.
- Virgil explains an angel comes to guide them up and Dante will later delight in these sights as he's meant to. The angel invites them to a less difficult stairway.
- A voice sings "Blessed are the merciful" and "Rejoice, overcomer!" as they ascend. Dante asks Virgil about the prohibition and sharing Guido spoke of.

- Dante and Virgil continue ascending through Purgatory, becoming lighter and moving faster
- Virgil asks Statius how he could have been greedy/avaricious when he was so wise during life
- Statius explains an apparent vice may hide a different spiritual truth; he was punished in Purgatory for prodigality/wasteful spending, which cleansed him of avarice
- He says Juvenal's words against human greed helped turn him from his excessive spending
- Statius identifies the vice that opposes a sin can heal that sin in Purgatory
- Virgil asks Statius about his conversion to Christianity, since his Thebaid poem didn't indicate faith

- Dante wonders how the spirits can waste away without need for food
- Virgil explains how the soul informs all the body's parts once blood is digested
- Statius adds that the soul originates from the heart then permeates the body's members
- He says the soul becomes sensitive like a sea fungus, eventually gaining intellect
- When life ends, the soul falls to one afterlife or the other, realizing its new state
- The air shapes itself to the soul's form, which then organizes the senses
- This explains shades, speech, tears, etc. - impressions matching souls' desires
- They reach the final terrace where flames burn pride; Dante fears falling off the narrow path
- He hears spirits chanting hymns as they walk through fire, shouting occasional cries
- Cries include: "I know not the man" (Peter denying Christ) and praise of Diana's chastity

- Dante explains he is still alive and journeying here with divine aid
- He asks them to identify themselves so he can record it
- One shade reveals himself as the poet Guido Guinizzelli
- Dante is amazed to meet this revered poet who influenced him
- Guinizzelli points out another spirit who was an even better "smith" of words, Arnaut Daniel
- Daniel speaks to Dante as well, requesting prayers when Dante returns to the land of the living

## Canto 27

- The lady turns to Dante and he compares her smile to Venus's brightness
- There is a three pace distance between them across the river
- The lady explains the Earthly Paradise was made for man's innocence
- After man's fall, this place remained untouched by worldly disturbances

- But she adds this is perhaps the mythical Golden Age the poets dreamed of
- An age of innocence, Spring and nectar, as some poets have spoken of

## Canto 29

Dante witnesses a divine procession including candlesticks, saints, Old Testament creatures, a griffin and chariot, nymphs and elders that comes to a halt with thunder as greeting is given to Beatrice.

- The lady sings "Blessed are those whose sins are covered" then moves on
- A bright light suddenly crosses the forest, making Dante think it's lightning
- Lovely music plays, reminding Dante of Eve's disobedience in Eden
- The air ahead becomes like fire as Dante hears singing
- Dante sees seven golden trees which turn out to be candlesticks
- Voices sing "Hosanna!" and saints appear dressed in white
- Reflections in the river allow Dante to see the procession on both sides
- Four animals with six feathered wings each come next, depicted in Ezekiel
- A chariot appears pulled by a Griffin, more splendid than any myths tell of
- Three dancing ladies lead, one red, one green, one white
- Four others in purple follow, led by one with three eyes
- Two old men come next - one like Hippocrates and one fierce with a sword
- Four humble looking men follow and then one elder walking asleep
- These wear roses and flowers as crowns rather than the lilies of the first group
- When the chariot reaches Dante, thunder sounds and all stop advancing

## Canto 30

Virgil departs as Beatrice angrily confronts Dante about him straying from her guidance, making him faint until revived to undergo confession and absolution crossing Lethe and Eunoe.

- The procession halts when the lead figures reach Dante
- One figure shouts out an invitation to the "bride" three times
- 100 rise up singing from the chariot in response, like the saved rising at judgment
- They sing praise to "Benedictus qui venis" (Blessed are you who come)
- Flowers rain down as they shout "Give lilies with full hands"
- A lady in white appears veiled under olive leaves, beneath a cloud of flowers
- Dante trembles with ancient love upon seeing her, the influence of Beatrice
- He tells Virgil his body shakes with traces of old flame though Virgil has left
- A voice tells Dante Virgil departed but Dante will cry from another's sword
- Across the river the lady is revealed as Beatrice when her eyes meet Dante's
- Beatrice asks how Dante dared come here; does he not know man is happy here?
- Dante looks down in shame under her gaze which holds a bitter compassion
- Beatrice falls silent as angels sing verses from the Psalm "In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust"
- Dante stands frozen in shame, melted only when the angels sing of pitying him
- Beatrice explains she once guided Dante right but he strayed pursuing false goods
- Her prayers and attempts to call him back failed; he fell so far only Hell could save him
- Beatrice visited Hell's gates in intercession, weeping; God's will would be violated if Dante tasted redemption without penitence

## Canto 31

Regaining consciousness, Dante looks on dumbfounded as Beatrice explains her efforts to save him before Savior-like746 she plunged him in Lethe, after which her beauty outshone her living self.

- Beatrice demands Dante confirm if it's true he strayed, as his confession hints
- Dante stammers out a shameful "Yes," overwhelmed like a crossbow overdrawn
- Beatrice asks what made him abandon the hope of loving that highest good
- What false pleasures turned him? What sights swayed him from the true path?
- Dante says only her concealed face led his steps astray
- Beatrice says his self-accusal increases shame to turn him from sin again
- She asks why her buried body which decayed did not deter his desire
- He should have risen to follow her; not waited for more enticements
- Beatrice tells Dante to lift his beard and he will feel greater pain seeing
- He looks up and sees the angels have stopped strewing flowers
- He sees Beatrice turned fiercely to the Griffin, more herself than when alive
- The thorn of guilt Dante feels turns Beatrice from beloved to accused
- Dante faints from self-reproach; coming to, Beatrice stands over commanding him
- She draws him through the river, singing praise he can't recall but can't write
- Emerging, Beatrice plunges him down thrice; ladies say they were her handmaidens
- They'll lead him to Beatrice's light-sharpening eyes; Griffin fastens his gaze
- Angels urge Beatrice unveil her face's second beauty for the faithful
- Dante wonders if any poet was as pale under inspiration's shadow
- Or unveiled the living light as Beatrice did under Heaven's harmony

## Canto 32

Marveling at Beatrice, Dante next sees the procession disrupted violently by a bird, fox, eagle, whore, and giant appearing on the chariot before witnesses cry out and the damaged base regrows its parts instantly.

- Dante is gazing at Beatrice when suddenly told he looks "too intently"
- Briefly dazzled, his sight returns to see the angels returning with the sun
- The angels pass by as the maidens turn the chariot carrying the Griffin
- Statius, Virgil, and Dante follow the chariot through the vacant forest
- They hear the angels cry "Adam!" circling a tree stripped bare of flowers
- They cry the seed of the just is preserved; the tree comes back to life
- The hymn the angels sing then is beyond what Dante can grasp or recall
- He tries to depict how he fell asleep like an artist painting drowsiness
- A voice wakes him asking "what are you doing?" as Peter/John/James at the Transfiguration
- Beatrice stands over him; he asks "where is Beatrice?" still confused
- She says Beatrice sits below newly leafed branches with circling angels
- Beatrice is left guarding the chariot; she tells Dante to fix his eyes on it
- Suddenly a bird of Jove descends and strikes the chariot violently
- Next a starving Fox enters the chariot, but Beatrice drives it away
- An Eagle descends and is rebuked for poorly loading the vehicle
- A Dragon emerges and tears part of the floor away before departing
- What's left regrows feathers instantly to remake the chariot parts
- Four new heads sprout with horns; a whore appears with a giant guarding her
- Enraged at the whore eyeing Dante, the giant whips then drags her away

## Canto 33

After the maidens sing in tears, Beatrice prophesies justice coming through an emissary from God while rebuking Dante's still sluggish awakening before Statius and Matilda lead him toward drinking from the Eunoe.

- The maidens sing a verse about seeing Mary briefly then seeing her again
- Beatrice rises and responds, quoting Jesus that they'll see her briefly, then again
- Beatrice places the seven ladies in front of her and signals Dante to follow
- After just ten steps she bids Dante draw near to speak with her
- She asks why Dante seems afraid to question her
- Beatrice dismisses such fear, saying the broken vase (sin) will be avenged
- The Eagle (empire) will return; she foresees one sent by God will slay the giant (corruption) and whore (papal greed)
- Her dark words like the Sphinx are to cloud intellects, but truth will come
- Dante must write this for those running towards spiritual death
- The twice-ravaged tree is holy, made for God's use alone
- Its heights and summit symbolize the soul craving redemption from the Fall
- Dante's intellect seems sluggish in recognizing the meaning
- So Beatrice will speak openly now that Dante has drunk from Lethe
- The ladies stop at a dark shadow where Dante sees the Tigris and Euphrates emerge from one stream then divide
- Dante asks what it means; Matilda says she told him but Lethe has obscured it
- Matilda and Statius will lead Dante to drink from the Eunoe river
- Dante wishes for space to describe that sweet draft, but his pages are full
- He returns regenerate like a renewed tree to climb towards the stars
