# Paradiso

Led by his idealized muse Beatrice, symbol of divine wisdom and theology, Dante makes his final ascension in the Divine Comedy to the celestial realm of Paradiso. As he passes through the concentric spheres of heaven, associated with the Moon, the planets Mercury to Saturn, the Fixed Stars, and finally the Primum Mobile which governs all, Dante encounters blessed souls in states of bliss and perfection. His spirit trembles in awe at witnessing divine mysteries past mortal ken.

Beatrice guides the amazed Dante first to the moon, elucidating the mystery of apparent blemishes reflecting earthly mutability. In Mercury's sphere, home to moral crusaders, the blessed soul Justinian details to Dante the providential order and harmony undergirding history's tumults. Next appearing in Venus's sphere, the lover Cunizza da Romano denotes heavenly joy eclipsing finite passions. Here Dante also converses with the troubadour Folquet de Marselha on society's injustice and holy crusades.  

Arriving in the Sun's glowing orb, Dante meets the doctors of wisdom Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Gratian, and others. They lament theology's worldly corruption. The Martians' red heaven features crusader Cacciaguida, who warns Dante of his impending Florentine exile. In Jupiter, eye of justice, Dante sees the saints form celestial writing praising divine justice. He learns from his ancestor Cacciaguida that temptation results from heavenly freedom despite God's omniscience.  

In Saturn's contemplative sphere, Dante speaks with ascetics like St. Benedict and St. Peter Damian. Among the celestial ladder of saints and angels in the Fixed Stars' shining realm, Dante is examined by St. Peter on faith before meeting the heavenly founder Adam. In the Primum Mobile's wheeling dance binding the cosmos, Dante beholds radiant angelic hierarchies adoring the light of God. Through the mystic Empyrean heaven of pure light and God's immanent presence, Dante passes enormous angelic choirs singing glories to the Virgin Mary with saints and Adam's blessed progeny. His vision climaxes with transcendentuniversal Truth when Dante gazes into infinite eternal Love, the Light moved by Its own goodness binding the order underlying all creation's multiplicity, the ultimate origin, purpose and bliss underpinning Dante's supreme poetic vision.

## Canto 1

The poet calls upon Apollo for inspiration and recounts a vision of ascending into the heavenly sphere of Paradise, guided by his beloved Beatrice, who urges him to gratefully fix his sights upon God.

- The poet tells some followers they can embark on the figurative sea journey, but others should turn back
- Beatrice looks up to heaven, and they instantly arrive at the sphere of the moon
- The poet tries to describe the incredible sights
- Beatrice explains spots on the moon are not caused by rarity of density
- She argues if that were the cause, the moon's light would shine through the thin parts
- Beatrice says the spots are caused by formal principles that produce variation in light
- She explains how the Intelligence moves the spheres, like an artisan wielding a hammer
- The spheres receive an imprint and radiate virtue and light outwards
- The mingling of virtue makes the light differ across stars and planets  
- Beatrice says this causes the differing darkness and brightness, not dense matter

## Canto 3

The poet beholds visions of souls prompting him to speak before Beatrice explains they broke vows but now abide happily in Paradise, and though she encourages him to listen, his intense distraction makes focusing difficult.  

- The poet sees visions of faces prompting him to speak
- Beatrice explains they are real substances who broke vows
- She tells him to speak to them and listen to the truth
- One spirit identifies herself as Piccarda who was forced from her convent
- She explains they are happy with their allotted sphere and God's will
- Piccarda says all the blessed spheres are pleasing as God's will is their peace 
- The poet asks why Piccarda did not fulfill her vows while alive
- She says a lady on Earth dictates how nuns should live to be true to vows
- Piccarda was forced back into secular life but in spirit kept her nun's vows 
- She points out another who was also forced to leave convent then vanishes singing

## Canto 4

Struggling internally between questions, the poet falls silent before Beatrice elucidates spiritual placement in the heavens and how violence against vows may be mitigated by fear, reconciling an apparent contradiction.

- The poet is unsure whether to ask about vows or souls returning to the stars
- Beatrice explains that blessed souls like Piccarda have seats in the primum mobile
- She says the lower sphere souls appeared to give a sign of less exalted heavens
- Beatrice adds that Scripture and theology sometimes simplify complex truths
- She argues if violence occurs without consent, sin may be reduced for the victim
- Beatrice clarifies that absolute will would never consent to sin but fear may
- The poet notes an apparent contradiction between Piccarda and Beatrice  
- Beatrice reconciles it by saying forced acts may be excused by fear of harm  
- The poet is overflowing with gratitude for Beatrice's wisdom dispelling doubts
- He humbly asks one more question about compensating for broken vows

## Canto 5

Answering the poet's earnest query, Beatrice discusses the inestimable value of free will in vows made with the divine, argues against substitutions without knowing the spiritual trade-offs involved, and admonishes Christians to soberly consider holy pacts, lest they merit mockery.  

- Beatrice explains intense love comes from seeing the eternal light
- The poet asks if vows can be compensated with other good deeds

- Dante hears the spirits singing praises to God in a dazzling display
- Beatrice explains that Dante is pondering how God's vengeance was just
- She says that Adam's sin condemned humankind, until Christ redeemed it
- The nature that Christ assumed was good, so the crucifixion pleased God by redeeming man but pained Him by sacrificing His son
- Dante still wonders why redemption required Christ's suffering specifically 
- Beatrice says God's goodness spurns envy and freely gives of itself
- Man fell from God's grace through sin, and could only be saved by God's mercy or man's penance
- God in His compassion found redemption through incarnation better than just pardoning

- It focuses on St. Francis, who came from Assisi and revitalized the Church with his devotion to poverty and love. 
- St. Francis renounced worldly pleasures and founded the Franciscan order with love and humility.

- He combatted heresy and founded the Dominican order to preach Church teachings.
- Dominic's order (symbolized as a wheel) helped steer the Church just as Francis' order did.  
- But Dominic's modern followers have strayed from his example of humility and poverty.  
- Still, Dominic's initial holy intentions and influence remain, the spirit argues.
- It praises Dominic so highly thanks in part to the words of Thomas Aquinas.

## Canto 13

Attempting to help Dante visualize splendid concentric spirit rings, a light explains perfect infusion of God's Light in Christ and Mary beyond all else, while Solomon had peerless wisdom for a king though all have different gifts.  

- Dante tries envisioning 15 brilliant stars forming two concentric rings spinning in opposite directions.
- This compares to the two rings of spirits dancing and singing praises to the Trinity around him. 
- One spirit stops the dance to address Dante's confusion about his previous words on perfection.  
- It explains that God's living Light flows through all creation in 9 levels, making transient imperfect things below.
- So the Virgin Mary and Christ had the full Light, no one else was their equal in perfection.
- But Solomon still had great wisdom, so was peerless in royal prudence when he asked God for wisdom to rule.
- One should judge carefully, not rejecting or affirming extremes without distinction like fools.
- Truth seeking without skill is useless, as Parmenides, Aristotle and others reasoning wrongly show.  
- Judge slowly, as the thorn bears the rose or ships sink at harbor despite smooth sailing.
- The judgments of God may raise up sinners and humble the pious unlike human eyes can tell.

## Canto 14

- The spirits cry "Amen!" eagerly awaiting their bodies and earthly loved ones' salvation.
- Dante sees more spirits appear, like a clearing sky at nightfall. 
- Beatrice smiles radiantly, but memory fails Dante to describe her beauty exceeding the other sights.

## Canto 15

A spirit asks how Dante could deny the silent spirits' prayer before describing Florence's former temperance and families intact, Cacciaguida's own baptism and martyrdom, and the Church's fault enabling the city's worsened leadership.

- A spirit quiets the singing circles and addresses Dante, wondering how he can deny just prayers.
- It compares unjust people ignoring righteous needs to someone abandoning eternal for fleeting love.
- A light swiftly moves like a shooting star to the foot of the cross, like a soul reaching toward its loved one.
- The spirit greets Dante joyfully, speaking profoundly at first beyond his comprehension.  
- It thanks God for enlightening Dante, who thinks correctly that all souls share one Truth source.

- He recalls being baptized in Florence, his wife from the Po Valley, brothers, and eventually dying a martyr.

- Instead of Beatrice, an Old Man bathed with joy tells Dante she sent him and indicates where to spot her in the third circle.
- Across vast distance, Dante sees Beatrice beaming, reflects thanks and devotion for her saving him, and she smiles back before turning to God again.
- The Old Man, identifying himself as St. Bernard, urges Dante to look all around at the divine sight to ready for ascent. 
- In the distance a pacific oriflamme banner glows brighter than the rest with a thousand joyful angels of varying kinds.
- At the center Dante sees a beautiful smiling being that shares gladness with all the saints, beyond his power to imagine or utter.

## Canto 32

An Old Man indicates heavenly circles and tells Dante that he sent Beatrice, who smiles at Dante from across far distances between realms of being.  

- Bernard indicates it's Mary at Jesus' feet who healed the wound she first lamented, seated near Rachel below her.
- He names Hebrew women ancestors of Jesus descending the rose's petals, dividing those believing in the Christ to come from those who saw him.
- Across the rose sits John the Baptist; with founders of orders like Francis and Benedict distributed in balanced faith. 
- Bernard dispels doubts that God's grace varies people's excellence for reasons unclear to Dante. Scripture shows God's free will in blessings.
- In early eras, salvation relied on parents' faith; later, males added virtue through circumcision; baptism came with Christianity.  
- Bernard urges looking at she most resembles Christ – Mary, where an Angel bearing palm had overflowing joy, singing her praise as all repeat it.
- Dante asks who the fiery angel is; Bernard names Gabriel, chief in grace. He names the rose's highest – Adam, Peter, Moses, Anna, Lucy. 
- Before thought can stray, Bernard proposes praying for heavenly grace to penetrate the divine light to the depth Dante can, starting holy prayer.

## Canto 33

Saint Bernard prays to Mary about nobility given human nature through God becoming man, seeking grace for Dante to see the Highest Pleasure before relating his vision of circles unified in God's depth.

- Bernard prays to Mary, mother and daughter of Jesus, the vessel of God becoming man and rekindling love that sprouted redemption's peace.
- He says Mary gives hope on earth and succor to those seeking grace, even outstripping requests. All goodness in creation unites in her.  
- He asks on Dante's behalf for power to see higher salvation, and that his mortal clouds be scattered to see the Chief Pleasure (God).
- Mary's eyes show her grateful delight. Gazing into the Light, Dante's desires end fulfilled as he looks into the true ray.
- What Dante sees surpasses describing; like a forgotten dream, the sweetness stays though vision fades. He implores memory's aid to convey the glory.
- The depth of boundless light holds the scattered universe's substance and actions fused into one; Dante rejoices perceiving the knot.
- His mind could never withdraw from this good fulfilling all desire; thus his speech falls shorter than an infant's.
- The one semblance changes as Dante does. He discerns circles of trinitarian light, mirrored, with the human form at center.
- Dante struggles for words to relate this vision of divine circles and images. Then lightning illuminates his wishing mind.  
- With will and desire spinning like wheels, vigour and fantasy fail before Love moving the heavens.
